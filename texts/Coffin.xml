        <epigraph>
          <p>"There be of them that have left a name behind them, that their praises might be
            reported." — Ecclesiastices, XLIV., 8.</p>
        </epigraph>
        <p>The life of Mrs. Coffin portrays to some extent the early record of many philanthropies,
          and is closely connected with movements which occupied her active years during the last
          half of the last century. Christian activity was the strong element in her nature. She
          turned to her Bible and her inner ear caught the words of Jesus when he took the ancient
          scroll, opened it and read: "The spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He hath anointed
          me to preach the Gospel to the poor; He hath sent me to heal the broken-hearted, to preach
          deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the bhnd, to set at liberty them
          that are bruised."</p>
        <p>When she received this vision of the Christ of the Gospels, touched with humanitarian im-
          pulse she consecrated herself to bear the stand- ard of the Lord in iwactical sendee, and
          soon pressed forward for the betterment of those in lowly conditions, the fallen and the
          outcast. She was not an idealist; her devising and shaping of methods, aided by earnest
          co-workers "in all their degrees," developed into practical things accomphshed. She did
          not choose easy tasks, nor did she take up popular causes because they were popular. She
          interested herself in the common affairs of those she helped, having higher possibilities
          and ends for them.</p>
        <p>She was optimistic in temperament, one who met life's tasks with good cheer, looking
          steadily at its hopeful side. She was not cast down at trouble, and sorrow did not despond
          her. She may sometimes have seemed radical in the advocacy of her policies and made
          mistakes, or been misunderstood, for her resourceful nature, her strong mentality and
          alert energy, gave her dominant traits. The works, ranging over a wide horizon, in which
          she took prominent part, are followed to-day with material benefits to the world.</p>
        <p>The fruitage of such a life we cannot measure or recite--no sum of her contribution to
          the up- lifting and betterment of human mankind can ever be given.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Coffin's personal reminiscences of her earlier years are presented at the request of
          her family in her own words, and as it was primarily</p>

        <p>Written for her sons and their children, the simple object of printing it has been that
          it may be placed in the hands of each member of her family. The insight it affords into
          the rustic farm life of a well-to-do Quaker family of eighty years ago, living in a then
          thickly wooded and unsettled part of our country, will not fail to be an interesting
          record to any who love historical narrative of the times and the people who carved out the
          new domain of our Middle West in the beginning of last century.</p>
        <p>She records the following narrative: I was born 2nd month 1, 1826, near a small village
          called Paintersville in Green County, Ohio.</p>
        <p>My parents were John and Judith Johnson. My father, the son of John and Rhoda Moorman
          Johnson, was born near Lynchburg, Virginia, 1st month 3d, 1795. His father, John Johnson,
          Jun., died early in the year 1803,<note n="1">John Johnson, Jun., died on, or about,
            January 14th, 1803.</note> when my father was eight years old, leaving his mother with
          five sons and one daughter. Her sixth son, James, was bom six weeks after his death. In
          1807 she disposed of her property in Vir- ginia, and with her family and necessary effects
          in a two-horse wagon, she left her native state and removed to Waynesville, Warren County,
          Ohio. I have heard my grandmother say that she was six weeks on the road.</p>

        <p>My mother was the daughter of David and Judith Faulkner who were natives of Virginia,
          living on Apple Pie Ridge, a few miles from Winchester. They re- moved from that state in
          the year 1800 on account of dissatisfaction with slavery, he having previously trav- elled
          on horseback from his home in Virginia to Ohio, entered a large tract of land, and built a
          small cabin. He returned, disposed of his property, and with his family in a two-horse
          wagon emigrated and settled in Warren County, Ohio. A great portion of the journey was
          through an unsettled country. Upon their arrival in Ohio they cleared and cultivated the
          heavily timbered farm. The climate proved very unhealthy, and they buried several
          children. It was at that time a malarial region.</p>
        <p>My father's parents were friends of my mother's parents — Grandfather and Grandmother
          Faulkner — and my Grandmother Johnson went directly to their home. Land had been selected
          for her at the head of Caesar's Creek near where the town of Jamestown now stands. There
          she settled and died.</p>
        <p>She was one of the noblest lookino* women I ever saw. With perfect health she never laid
          by a day for any of her children, and never had one day's illness until the last week of
          her life, when death came in her eightieth year.</p>
        <p>Courageously she toiled to care for, educate and sup- port her children. With them she
          went into the for- est, felled the trees and cultivated the ground, raising the crops
          which supported her family. My father was twelve years old when they left Virginia in
          1807. Her six sons, noble, staunch and true, grew to be men of influence and always
          entertained for their mother the deepest love and the greatest admiration, and rever-
          ence. All of them married except one who was not strong and never inclined to marriage.
          Three of her sons each named a daughter for her. I had her full name, of which I have
          always been proud. Her only daughter married when quite young, ^James Bryant, who was
          several years her senior, and brought up a large family of children.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Grandfather Faulkner had left Waynes- ville on account of its unhealthfulness,
          although the soil was fertile and the scenery beautiful. He entered three thousand acres
          of land for himself and his chil- dren in Clinton County, Ohio, where Wilmington, the
          county seat of Clinton County, is now situated. This, too, proved malarial, as indeed was
          the greater part of the State in those days. After li\dng here some years, he divided his
          land among his three sons, and settled himself eight miles north, midway between
          Wilmington and Xenia, where he lived until the 30th of 1st month, 1821, when he died
          suddenly.</p>
        <p>My Grandmother Faulkner lived in the same place until 4th month £3rd, 1843, when she died
          in her eighty- fourth year. She was a great sufferer from asthma for many years, and much
          of the time during her latter years, was confined to the house. She was tall, erect,
          rather stout, of strong personality and character. Her daughters resembled her in
          appearance and characteristics.</p>
        <p>I loved to sit beside her on a little stool, as she sat in the corner, her needle case,
          thread, wax and scissors hanging by her on the wall, and by her side a table with her
          Bible and work-basket. She would sew, knit, or spin, on her " little wheel," and tell me
          stories of their pioneer life, full of interest to me. For many years, with the assistance
          of her daughters, she spun and wove all of the bedding, table linen and clothing for her
          large family.</p>
        <p>My Grandfather and Grandmother Faulkner were staunch Friends, both by education and
          conviction, active Elders, and influential members of the church.</p>
        <p>When my father was about sixteen years of age, he went to live with my Grandfather
          Faulkner, whose sons had all left home. When my father was not needed on the farm, he
          worked for neighbors nearby who needed extra help. One man for whom he worked was a car-
          penter. From him, father learned something of that trade. With another he learned
          something of brick making, which served him good pui'pose in after life. From this
          experience, he had a tender feeling for all young men who had their living to make by "
          hiring out "as day laborers.</p>
        <p>Whilst thus engaged, a mutual attachment was formed between my father and my mother,
          which even- tually culminated in their marriage. My mother was trained in early life to
          hardship and toil. The women washed the wool, carded it, spun it and wove it into the
          cloth, of whatever kind desired, jeans, flannels, etc. They made all the clothing worn by
          the family. The flax was broken, hackled and made clean, spun into thread and woven into
          linen for shirts, underwear, table and bed linen, towels, etc. The wool was also spun and
          woven into blankets and coverlids, some of the de- signs being quite pretty. I have one of
          the coverlids which my Grandmother made shortly after her mar- riage, and one which my
          mother made before her mar- riage. The geese were picked from which were made the feather
          beds and pillows. In short, everything needful for the family use was done by the women.
          The men toiled at opening up their heavily timbered farms. The trees were cut down, logs
          rolled and sawed with a "cross-cut saw," and thus the ground was prepared to raise
          crops.</p>
        <p>My Grandfather Faulkner gave to each of his daughters a half-section of land, having the
          idea, which still prevails, that the daughters did not need as much as the sons.</p>
        <p>My father and mother were married 5th month, 22nd, 1816, at Center Meeting, eight miles
          from Paintersville, and three miles from Wilmington. My mother "passed Meeting" in a
          purple bombazine dress, not unlike the alpaca of the present day. She was married in a
          light crepe dress. These she kept until my sister Phoebe was fourteen years of age, when
          she made a dress for Phoebe out of the crepe and one for me out of the bombazine. I have
          heard her say, that when ready to start for Meeting to be married her father took her out
          to the "horse block" from which a woman could mount a horse, and gave her a fine bay
          horse, with a new saddle and bridle. He talked with her a few minutes of the life she was
          entering, kissed her, lifted her into the saddle, gave her the reins and a new riding
          whip, and turned for his own horse, the big tears rolling down his cheeks. A horse, saddle
          and bridle were often given by the father as a bridal gift to his daughter. The mother had
          prepared such things as were absolutely necessary to commence house- keeping, the outfit
          of necessity being simple.</p>
        <p>Her parents gave her a deed to one-half section of land, on which my Grandfather had
          built a small cabin. Here they began housekeeping, in an unbroken forest, with little else
          but two horses, a cow and a few agri- cultural implements, but with two pairs of willing
          hands and two loving hearts, strong in purpose, strong in body, and with a will that knew
          no such thing as fail.</p>
        <p>Their son Brooks Johnson, was bom 8th month 8rd, 1817, his name being the maiden name of
          Grandmother Faulkner's mother. He was a vigorous, healthy child, and grew up full of
          courage and energy, and was a great help to my parents.</p>
        <p>Their second son, Joel Wright, was bom 7th month, 30th, 1819. He also was a great comfort
          to my mother; gentle, loving and helpful. As he grew and became of age, he did everything
          possible to assist her when he could be made available. At the time of his death, he was
          engaged to be married to Rachel Smith, a daugh- ter of James and Mary Smith, who lived
          three miles below Wajnesville on the Little Miami River. Brother Joel settled on a farm,
          adjoining my father's, a mile east of Waynesville. He died 10th month, 23rd, 1849.</p>
        <p>The other children of my parents were as follows:</p>

        </list>
        <p>Through all this period, my mother filled her place in life with a courage and devotion
          rarely met. She was a tall, well-proportioned woman, perfectly erect, with shoulders
          thrown back, strong, well-developed fea- tures, fair complexion, bright blue eyes, jet
          black hair, a handsome woman, and as I remember her, would weigh about 170 lbs. She was
          systematic in every detail of her household, energetic, full of courage, ambitious and
          deeply sympathetic with all who were in trouble, sorrow or suffering. She was a fine cook,
          a good housekeeper and very industrious. She prepared the clothing for her own household
          from the wool or the flax for many years, until manufactories opened within reach.</p>
        <p>My father was a slender man of about 150 lbs. weight, 5 feet 11 inches in height, very
          fair complexion, light blue eyes and dark hair. He had versatile talents of no small
          order. Neither of them were stout. He had a sagacious, strong, well-balanced mind and
          excellent judgment. Commencing life with little education, by seizing every available
          means, cultivating every opportunity, reading and studying, he became a fairly educated
          man. Facilities for acquiring knowl- edge were not so great then as in this day,
          especially in country places. Hence to procure a reasonable edu- cation required great
          effort. He was industrious and enterprising. Having learned stone masonry, and how to make
          and bum brick, he built all of the brick houses in the neighborhood. Before I was born he
          built for himself a brick house of two rooms, also one for Grand- father Faulkner in which
          both he and Grandmother lived until their death. That house is still standing but little
          changed. They prospered and added to their comforts such things as seemed to be needed.
          His brother James, when about fourteen years of age, came to live with them. I was born on
          the 1st of 2nd month, 1826, and brought, as I have been told, great joy to the
          household.</p>
        <p>My sister Phoebe was a very delicate child, with little hold on life, hence as I was a
          healthy, strong child, full of life, I found a royal welcome, particularly by my father.
          When I was very young, I was sent to school to Evan Harris, who taught in the District
          School house, about three-quarters of a mile from home. The teacher boarded at our house
          and seeing my mother so laden with cares, he prevailed on her to let me go with him to
          school. The schoolhouse was a log cabin, with a large fire-place at one end, and benches
          all around the room which had no backs. Hence the seats next to the wall were in demand,
          as the children could lean back against the wall. The teacher kept several switches, which
          he used most freely. Often have I seen him call up young men, make them take off their
          coats, and give them a sound thrashing, sometimes sending them out to cut the sticks with
          which he whipped them.</p>
        <p>All of the scholars studied their lessons aloud, each trying to excel the other in the
          volume of voice. Those whom the teacher could trust were allowed in pleasant weather to go
          out in the forest which surrounded the cabin, to study. They made the woods ring with the
          noise, particularly when studying spell- ine:. There were no blackboards and the scholars
          were not arranged in classes, except for recitation in spell- ing and reading. Much
          attention was given to these studies. On each Friday afternoon the school chose two "
          captains." These chose alternately one of the scholars for his side, until all who could
          spell were on one side or the other. The teacher then took the spell- ing book and gave
          out words from the portion passed over previously, each scholar spelling in turn. When any
          pupil missed spelling a word he must sit down, and the opposite side take it, and so on,
          until all had failed but one.</p>
        <p>Once a month, the spelling of the past month was reviewed, and the defeated side must
          treat the school to apples and cider. If a tie occurred, as some times did, the teacher
          must treat. Often when visitors came in, I was "stood up" on the teacher's table to read
          for their entertainment. I had a natural taste for spelling and reading, and would read
          with great fluency, paying no attention to the commas or periods, until I was exhausted
          and must stop for breath.</p>
        <p>I went two years to the Evan Harris school, and on the last day we had a spelling match.
          My cousin, Mordecai Painter, and I were very near the same age, and were chosen captains.
          We spelled down all the school, and then spelled for some time alone, when the teacher
          gave us "Quelque chose." Our knowledge of French was not sufficient to cope with this, and
          we both sat down, amid the cheers of the school. The teacher gave the treat. I have for
          him a fond remembrance. Although sometimes severe to others, he never spoke an unkind word
          to me. Many times he carried me on his back to the school in stormy weather. He laid the
          basis for spelling and readiness in reading. His failures were corrected by my next
          teacher, Morris Pritchard, from Raysville, Henry County, Indiana.</p>
        <p>This teacher was an entirely different character, treated every one with respect and
          consideration. I loved school, learned with great readiness and was never punished. Not
          because I was so good, but because I loved to study and was always busy.</p>
        <p>Mordecai Painter and his sister Lydia, were my play- mates. His father and my mother were
          first cousins.</p>

        <p>We lived near together and the families were strongly attached. Their parents were devout
          Methodists and faithful to morning and evening devotions, all the family kneeling and
          usually the father called on some one of them to pray. I delighted to spend the night
          there, that I might be present on these occasions.</p>
        <p>Friends had much to say in their Meetings on the awful solemnity of prayer, of
          approaching God vocally, but in that family they came simply to God and seemed, to my
          young mind, to be talking to him face to face, and I longed for the same privilege. The
          thought that it was awful to pray to God was repugnant to me. If He was really our Father,
          He would hear us at any time when we wanted to talk to Him.</p>
        <p>After these visits I kept thinking about it and longing to talk with Him. At last I went
          out behind the barn, by a straw rick, and there knelt down, after having looked all around
          to see if any one was near, and told Him all about how I felt; that I wanted to know if I
          might not come to feel that He was in Heaven, that I was His child, and would He please
          make us all Methodists, so that we could all come to- gether and talk with Him, just like
          my cousins did. It was a very simple, awkward prayer, but God heard it.</p>
        <p>He did not make me a Methodist, but He made me His child. I rose from my knees so happy.
          It was such a sweet thought that I had really talked vrith God, just like I did with my
          father. From that date I loved to pray and the spirit of it has never ceased.</p>

        <p>I did not know then, but I now know that I had re- ceived new life, and a new
          relationship with my Father in Heaven. I kept it very quiet.</p>
        <p>My parents were praying people and taught us of silent prayer, and the necessity of
          obeying God and keeping His laws.</p>
        <p>Those were dark days in the Church. The protest against formality had run into the most
          rigid formal- ism. There were many noble men and women (among these were my parents)
          staunch and true Christians, do- ing what they/ conceived to be right, and rigidly
          training their children in the straight and narrow way, and it was a narrow one.</p>
        <p>My parents were members of Newhope Particular Meeting, about a mile from our house. We
          children generally walked to Meeting. On one occasion,—I remember it well,—my mother had
          bought each of us a liffht calico dress. It cost, as she afterwards told me, fifty cents a
          yard, and was considered very nice. She made us some pink bonnets, and gave each of us a
          little handkerchief. When we were dressed up we felt very fine, never more so, and started
          to walk to Meet- ing, with our little handkerchiefs folded and hung over our arms. We were
          very much pleased with our outfit and walked along admiring ourselves. But when we were
          seated in Meeting and there was solemn silence, I observed that I had lost my
          handkerchief. I was greatly troubled. The tears ran down my cheeks during all the meeting.
          What should I do.? I was watched by Joel Thornburg, an uncle of my mother's, a venerable
          minister who seldom spoke, but sat with his chin resting on his folded hands over the top
          of the cane which he usually carried. He was always dressed in drab. He shook hands with
          my Grandmother Faulkner, who was an Elder and sat by his side. I was so glad my father and
          mother, who were Overseers of the Meet- ing, sat on a seat below them. Joel Thornburg saw
          my distress and came to me to inquire the cause. Dili- gent search was made, but I never
          saw the handker- chief again. I am sure my sorrow for that loss was as heavy for me as
          much greater ones have been since. It made a lasting impression, and in after years caused
          me to remember children's sorrows as not to be lightly passed over.</p>
        <p>There was no such thing as a carriage in the neigh- borhood, hence father and mother
          either went about in a two-horse wagon, or on horseback. When we went with them on
          horseback they would take a child behind that was large enough to hold on to their waists,
          and the smaller ones in their arms in front.</p>
        <p>My brother Eli was bom in 1830, 9th month, 25th, and sister Rachel in 1832, 10th month,
          20th. These two children were a great delight to me. They were great pets. Eli was very
          bright and loved to work. When ten 3'ears old he could be put into a field to plough by
          himself, where he would be as diligent as thouffh father were with him. Rachel had a sweet
          and gentle disposition and was very handsome.</p>
        <p>In 1832 father, with the help of his older sons, burned the brick and built himself a new
          brick house, a brick milkhouse, woodhouse, and smokehouse. The dwellings house still
          stands.</p>
        <p>I think it was in August, 1868, when my second son, Charles Heniy, and I drove in a
          carriage through the country by Eaton, Springboro, and Waynesville, stopping for a few
          hours to visit my old home, and then to Wilmington and Martinsville, Clinton County, Ohio,
          to attend a series of Meetings held by the Committee on "General Meetings," appointed for
          that service by the Indiana Yearly Meeting. I was a member of the Committee.</p>
        <p>After several days' service we left for Richmond, Indiana, by way of Wilmington, Xenia,
          Dayton, and Eaton, Ohio, being desirous of once more seeing my native home, my birthplace.
          The road from Wilming- ton to Paintersville was full of interest. Many changes had
          occurred. Much of the land, once swampy woodland, was now well drained and very fertile.
          We passed by old Center Meeting House, three miles from Wilmington, where my parents were
          married, and where the Monthly and Quarterly Meetings to which we belonged when living
          near Paintersville, were ithen and are still held. As we stopped at the little old Meeting
          House, and sat upon the old seats, my memory went back to early times. We visited the
          graveyard near by where my grand- father and grandmother were buried, and many rela- tives
          and friends. It was in a most dilapidated condition, with no tombstones to mark the
          special resting places.</p>
        <p>From thence we went to Grandfather's old home. The house which mj father had built, still
          standing in a good state of preservation, was occupied by a cousin, Azel Walker. We found
          the spring house, with its everlasting spring, and the old well-sweep for drawing the
          water from the well, still in use. We then went to my old home a half-mile further on. The
          bam which my father built was still filling a useful place. It was here that I first
          prayed to my Heavenly Father, a sacred spot to me. The dwelling house was but lit- tle
          changed. It was well kept and looked bright and cheery. The wife of the owner kindly
          allowed me to go over the house. I was disappointed to find the cherry trees, one hundred
          of them, which my father had planted and from which we had gathered cherries, were all
          gone. The old apple orchard, with its fine pippins and "Seek-no-Furthers," the plum
          thicket, and the frog pond where we spent so many hours in our play, were gone, and in
          their places were a new orchard and a fine field of com.</p>
        <p>I was heartsick. The thought had never occurred to me of the changes which had, as a
          matter of course, taken place. My reason would have taught me, had I thought, but the
          memory of the childish scenes of the old home, were so imprinted upon my mind that time
          and events had not effaced it.</p>
        <p>I felt that I must see the "Painter's Run," that ran through the field, where we had so
          often waded, and sometimes got a little spanking for it when we had been forbidden. It was
          a spirited little creek, and at times was deep and dangerous. There I had seen the sheep
          driven in and washed, preparatory to shearing.</p>
        <p>As I made my way through the cornfield, I met a man ploughing. When I drew near, he
          looked at me eagerly for a moment, dropped his reins, and with both hands outstretched
          came towards me, saying, "Excuse me, but is this not Rhoda Johnson, the little girl that I
          used to carry 'pick-a-pack' to school? — It is the very same face." It was John Ary, the
          owner of the property. We had not met since I was nine years of age. I was now the mother
          of six children, and he proudly said, "I am ahead of you, I have ten. I have changed, but
          you have the same look you had vWien you were a little girl."</p>
        <p>When I was between eight and nine years of age (1834^), my father sold his farm for
          $2500, and bought from Abijah O'Neall for $5000 a farm seventeen miles from our old home
          and one mile east of Waynesville. <note n="2">This estate afterwards bore the name of
            "Diamond Hill."</note> The house was a large brick one, with a big kitchen, beautifully
          located on a high hill. The farai had rich " bottom land " on the Little Miami River. My
          father felt that he must give his children better opportunities.</p>
        <p>The removal was a great event in our lives, and changed the whole tenor of them. In
          September, 1835, we left Paintersville early one morning. My mother regretted leaving her
          mother and those of her family who lived near her, and going to a strange place, to new
          sun-oundings and associations. But to her children it was novel and full of interest.
          Mother rode on horseback and carried sister Rachel, who was a baby, in her arms. The boys
          drove the stock, and father and Uncle James drove the wagons, the latter having kindly
          volunteered to help us move. We children rode in the wagons, or when we were tired we got
          out and walked. Our neighbors had cooked an abundance of food for us, enough to last
          several days. We arrived at our new home about four in the afternoon, having travelled
          seventeen miles, a great journey for us chil- dren, who had never before been so far away.
          We children were full of excitement, exploring the new home, while the older ones were
          busy, some caring for the stock, others in carrying and arranging the furni- ture. But our
          poor mother was not so enchanted, for she, fatigued with her journey, entered an empt}^
          house, with supper to get, and beds to be arranged. She sat down and wept. Father hurried
          up the fire, put the kettle of water over the fire, and then came to com- fort our dear
          mother, so dear to his life and of whom he was so fond. I remember the scene so well. None
          of us could bear to see mother weep. She was a person of great energy and soon was bright
          and cheery. We sat down to a good supper, and ere long were all at rest.</p>
        <p>Waynesville is situated on the side of a hill over- looking; the Little Miami River and
          its rich vallevs. Since then I have travelled much over the world, but have seldom seen a
          more beautiful country. My father's farm was situated opposite the village, with the river
          running through it. The house, as I have said, was situated on a high hill. There was an
          expansive view all around. The "County Road" leading from Waynesville through Harveysburg
          to Wilmington passed on the north line. The "County Road" lead- ing from Waynesville to
          Clarksville passed on the east line. <note n="3">
            <p>The following "Recollections" of this old homestead were written by a citizen of
              Waynesville, Ohio, and published in the "Miami Gazette" in 1892.</p>
            <p>On the hill top, over the Little Miami river and across the valley, there stands an
              old historic house; it is not a ruin, it is not in decay, its walls are not weather
              stained nor moss grown, but it is an ideal home; not merely a habitation, but a home
              in everything which the name implies; a center around which the affections cling and
              to which memory goes back with fond recollections.</p>
            <p>For nearly one hundred years those old walls have stood there; their open portals
              have been the objective point of many a belated and weary traveler, where he was at
              least sure of wel- come and rest.</p>
            <p>In October of 1798 Abijah O'Neall and Samuel Kelly bought of Dr. Jacob Roberts Brown
              his military claim of 3310 acres of land situated in the Virginia Military
              Reservation north of the Ohio river. A part of that purchase lay on the east side of
              the Little Miami river opposite the town of Waynesville and was known as Brown's
              Survey No. 791, containing 660 acres, the patent for which was issued to Abijah
              O'Neall, as signee of Jacob Brown and bears date at Washington, Jan. 17, 1800. The
              consideration was 66 cents per acre. Mr. O'Neall moved his family to Waynesville in
              the autumn of 1799, and the following winter made some improvement on the present
              Diamond Hill farm. In the spring of 1800 he moved his family into a rude log house
              wliich had been constructed and began to make a home. The beginning was rude and many
              privations were to be borne. At that time I am not aware that there was a square rod
              of cleared ground on the east side of the Little Miami river north of where the town
              of Morrow now is, yet wherever a tree was cut dovra so the sunlight could strike the
              ground, anything that was planted would grow. Corn was the great staple; it furnished
              not only bread for the family and food for the stock but the fodder was the rough food
              for the -winter, hay not being attain- able; sometimes hay was cut and cured on the
              prairie lands north- east of Xenia, and afterwards hauled eighteen miles over emigrant
              trails; but this made very expensive provender. Time and labor bring many things.
              Sowly the forest receded, acre by acre the fields were enlarged, houses were built and
              men had come to stay. With the influx of immigration there came many wants. The first
              school that was taught in the settlement was taught by Joel Wright in 1803 at Mr.
              O'Neall's house. He also taught in 1804, 1805, and in 1807, and in 1808 Elizabeth
              Wright, sister of Joel, taught in the same place.</p>
            <p>In the meantime many changes had taken place around the rude home; gardens had been
              made, orchards planted, wells sunk and substantial out-buildings erected. In 1803 a
              church had been organized (the Friends) and so rapid had been the influx of Friends
              from older states, that in 1805 it is said there were more than one thousand names on
              its church books.</p>
            <p>In 1808 the present substantial brick house was built. There have been changes made
              in the interior construction; windows have been enlarged, doors closed up or new ones
              made, porches built with a gable placed here or a balcony hung there, until it is
              modernized into a handsome suburban residence, but the old walls of 1808 are still
              intact, and it is the same old house.</p>
            <p>Mr. O'Neall was a surveyor and a large dealer in land, was a prominent member in the
              Society of Friends, and probably no man in the whole countryside had a larger
              acquaintance than he. It was to him that the emigrant came when he was hunting a place
              to locate his home; to him the settlers went to have their disputed boundary lines
              adjusted; to him every scheme for the betterment of the country was brought; his house
              was alike open to rich and poor; his door was never closed to an applicant for shelter
              nor his charity withheld from a worthy solicitor. Such men as Gov. Morrow, Col,
              Richard C. Anderson, of Louisville, Ken- tucky, and Judge Burnett, of Cincinnati, were
              his close personal friends, but perhaps the most distinguished guest ever entertained
              at the Diamond Hill home was the great Indian Chief, Little Turtle, Chief of the
              Miamis, than whom there was no finer speci- men of Indian character. It was he who
              commanded the Indians at Harmer's defeat in 1791, at St. Clair's defeat in November of
              the same year. Of him E. D. Mansfield. Editor of the Cin- cinnati Gazette says: "The
              most acute and sagacious Indian statesman; he had wit, humor and intelligence; an
              extensive traveler and a polished gentleman." It was his last visit to Southern Ohio,
              and he looked for the last time upon the beautiful valley of the Miami, and bade
              farewell to each hill, and wood and stream forever.</p>
            <p>During the War of 1813, many of the friendly Shawnee In- dians were sent from
              Northern Ohio, into the settlements to get them out of danger of being massacred by
              the hostiles, and at least two of these, a mother and daughter, the wife and child of
              General Harrison's interpreter (Charles Ash) were for many months inmates of Mr.
              O'Neall's household.</p>
            <p>In all those days of early pioneer life it would be safe to say that there was never
              a key turned nor a bolt thrown in a door, but that all were free to come and go
              without a question, sure of a welcome.</p>
            <p>In 1823, Mr. O'Neall died and the homestead passed to his youngest son, Abijah, jr.
              The mantle of the father descended naturally to the son. In 1834 he sold the premises
              to Mr. John Johnson, and moved his family to Western Indiana.</p>
            <p>Mr. Johnson, the new owner of Diamond Hill, was the eldest of three brothers who
              owned farms which lie adjoining. The family were all members of the Friends' church,
              and as the unhappy division had taken place in 1828, they were attached to the
              Orthodox branch of that denomination.</p>
            <p>The two oldest brothers were enthusiasts in everything per- taining to educational
              matters, and their children enjoyed the best advantages which the neighborhood
              afforded. The home of Mr. Johnson was a common center, a rallying point, and as there
              were twenty-eight first cousins in the three families, all living within a circle of a
              mile, the house was always gay with young society. The juniors brought their lessons,
              their recitations, and their ebullitions of wit and humor home with them from school
              and the circle around the broad hearth was sparkling with sallies of youth. With such
              surroundings there was no chance for one to grow rusty or old. How could old age find
              a resting place in such a household?</p>
            <p>On the settlement of Mr. Johnson's estate, which took place about 1847, the farm
              passed into the hands of Edward Lynch, ol Lynchburg, formerly of Lynchburg,
            Va.</p></note> Uncle Micajah and Aunt Rebecca Johnson, with their large family, lived on
          a farm adjoining on the Clarksville Road.</p>
        <p>The land had been much exhausted by unskillful farming, but my father was a good farmer,
          and soon made it to "Blossom as the rose." My three elder brothers, Brooks, seventeen
          years of age, Joel, fifteen, and David, thirteen years old, were healthy, energetic,
          industrious boys, and gave him valuable aid.</p>
        <p>We had entered on a new scene of action. The people were more cultured, the schools were
          much better and our advantages greater in every way.</p>

        <p>"There is not a human life that is now potent for good, which is not shaped and swayed in
          large measure by the influence of lives which have passed from earth." — Selected.</p>
        <p>For my father and mo'ther I have no words but of praise and thanksgiving. Their
          self-sacrifice, their tender care, firm discipline, training in industrious hab- its and
          perseverance to overcome all obstacles, have been of much value to me. We were taught to
          work, and must needs labor. My father was a scientific farmer, taught not by books but by
          personal observation. He used to explain to me when he took me out into the fields, why he
          did certain things, the difference in the soil, its adaptability to certain seeds, why he
          did this and w^hy he did not do that, and how he did it. I loved to go with him when he
          was dropping the com. He would take two rows, and give me one, then step- ping over and
          helping me with mine, he talked with me and explained different things in which he saw I
          was interested. Thus he taught me habits of obser- vation. He never punished me without
          explaining why he did it.</p>
        <p>But this delightful mode of life could not last. Mv mother needed me in the house, for
          she was over-bur- dened with work. I could attend the children, run er- rands, and
          standing upon a bench which father had made for me, wipe the dishes. The family was large,
          and reliable female service could not be procured. I entered on new duties and learned new
          lessons, but the free life I had led suited my inclination better.</p>
        <p>We had good schools in the winter which we children all attended. Our mother put up nice
          lunches for us, cold fresh backbones and spare ribs, doughnuts, apples, and the best of
          mince pies. She would bake thirty or forty at a time in the big Dutch oven. They were
          superior to anything we have now. We were all ex- pected to help with the work mornings
          and evenings. In inclement weather we rode to school, two or three on one horse. Our
          parents were very careful that their daughters should not be unduly exposed. Thus the
          outdoor life, which I led joyfully, and the indoor, of necessity'- until it became a
          pleasure, formed the basis of a good constitution, never knowing a day's illness during my
          single life. The natural energy was culti- vated both by precept and example.</p>
        <p>Life moved on apace. Years passed by without any striking event. By my mother's side, and
          under her direction, I was taught all kinds of work that it was needful for a woman to
          know, excepting weaving. This I did not learn, as my mother's loom had been left at the
          old home. I was taught to spin wool on the "large wheel," and flax and cotton on the
          "small wheel." I soon could spin my "dozen cuts" a day on either, which was considered a
          full day's work. No homes where we lived had carpets on the floors ; indeed, I had never
          seen but one. We must needs have them in our new home, as my mother said she did not
          intend to live differently from our friends around us. Cast-off clothing was cut into
          strips, about half an inch wide. Such as were dull in color were dyed bright colors. They
          were tacked together and wound Into balls ready for the weaver. The chain we spun, usually
          out of "tow," the refuse of the hackling of the flax. This was dyed, and the two woven
          into a carpet, such as was in general use. They were sometimes quite pretty, and always
          serviceable.</p>
        <p>My father, in a few years, tore down the log kitchen, and built a brick addition with a
          dining-room and kitchen, and chambers above. Year by year we worked upon the carpents,
          until we had all the rooms carpeted, which was a great saving of scrubbing and labor. For
          our reception-hall, which was a large hall through the center of the house, mother and I
          spun the chain of tow and the filling of wool, dyed the different parts to meet the
          pattern by which it was made, and by the Autumn we had the pride and pleasure of laying on
          our floors forty yards of "Venetian" carpet, as it was then called.</p>
        <p>The wool was spun into yam, and the stockings knit for all the household for Winter, and
          for Summer flax was spun into thread and knit into stockings. By my mother's provident
          care, her knitting was always a year ahead of the needs. Wool pickings, carpet tack- ings,
          quiltings, apple parings, for drying apples or making apple butter, were not uncommon. The
          neigh- bors came In and helped for help In turn. They usu- ally spent the day and had a
          good meal and pleasant social life, which we all enjoyed. There was but little else in the
          way of amusement.</p>
        <p>Our evenings in the Winter, after having done the evening's work, was spent first in
          studying our lessons, then mother and daughters knit or sewed, while father or one of the
          sons read aloud from a book. Some- times we sang, for my father was a beautiful singer,
          and could detect a false note in an instant. We loved to hear him sing, and were never
          more delighted than when he would indulge us. At other times apples were brought in and
          nuts cracked and eaten. Then father retired, and all who chose sat up later. He loved to
          go to bed early and get up early, mother liked just the opposite. It was at such times
          that she gave us those personal talks, which to me have been so valuable, the importance
          of governing our appetites and control- ling our passions. Those delicate subjects, and
          delicate thoughts, were conveyed in the most delicate manner, but with no uncertain sound,
          enjoining purity of thought, purity of action, and manner of conduct to- ward the opposite
          sex, and as each one entered the marriage relation, she did not leave us uninstructed as
          to our new relations, its privileges, its responsibilities and duties. To her I owe much
          of the happiness of my married life.</p>
        <p>The training was rigid, but filled with love. Ours was a loving home. We were happy in
          each other. We were taught to try to surmount every difficulty. Farm life is a barren life
          at best, intolerable where love is absent, but we knew no better, and we knew no other
          life as our associates had the same surround- ings.</p>
        <p>We had no Sunday-schools, but our parents taught us the Bible. My mother always read the
          Bible with an "intonation." I loved to hear her read. We were taken to Meeting when it was
          possible. We loved to go, although the Meetings were mostly in silence. It is quite
          probable that the change and chance to see our friends and talk with them was the prime
          cause of our desire to go to Meeting. We rarely heard a sermon except when a "travelling
          Minister" came.</p>
        <p>We had very pleasant associates. My Uncle Micajah Johnson with his ten children,
          three-quarters of a mile from us, uncle James Johnson with his eleven chil- dren, only one
          and a half miles away, and our family of seven made a group of itself. Then there were the
          families of Thomas Evans, James Smith, the Samuel Jones', and Browns, and many others, all
          of whom were leading, active Friends.</p>
        <p>At Springboro, eight miles away, there were the Butlers, the Batemans, the Stantons,
          the Strouds, and others, and there was much intermingling. Our asso- ciations was largely
          with Friends. We had a large Quarterly [Meeting at Waynesville. The Cincinnati Friends
          belonged to it. Some of them always attended and brought into our midst no inconsiderable
          amount of refinement, Harriet Steer, William Grossman, the Taylors, Morgans, Anthonys, the
          Bonsalls, and others.</p>
        <p>Our house was always open to Friends, and many of them were frequent visitors. At Center
          Quarterly Meeting, fourteen miles east, there were George Carter, Joseph Doane, Abraham
          and Jacob Carpenter, and many other of our warm personal friends. The pres- ence of these
          and their personal influence had much to do in moulding my life for future action.</p>
        <p>In September, 1842, my brother Brooks married Lydia Burson, the daughter of Dr. Edward
          and Jemima Burson, after the order of Friends, in Wilmington Meeting, she being a member
          there. Though very young, sixteen years old, I was one of the bridesmaids. It was quite an
          event in my life. Lydia was a most lovely woman, handsome, bright, lively and warm-
          hearted. She was welcomed into our house as a great treasure. There immediately sprang up
          between us the closest sisterly relations. She entered with zest into all that interested
          me, and attached me closely to her. She was the more valuable, as I was just entering
          society. This I did very early, as my elder sister v/as an invalid, and my three brothers
          older than myself, desired a sister to receive company and to go with them to the homes of
          young ladies. My father never allowed me to go out in the evening unattended by one of my
          brothers, nor ever on any account to stay out after 10 p. m. If I must needs remain longer
          I must stay all night. I could receive young gentlemen at home all I wished, but they must
          leave at 10 p. m. I used to feel the rigidity of the rules then, but as I look back to my
          training, I see the wisdom of it.</p>
        <p>A short time after my brother's marriage, I went to Richmond, Indiana, to attend the
          Indiana Yearly Meeting of Friends held at that place. We went in our two-horse carriage.
          There were no railroads then in that part of the country. All went to the Yearly Meeting
          in carriages, wagons, or on horseback. We stopped at a hotel kept by William Nixon, where
          the Huntington House afterward stood. The cost for board at that time was $2.50 per week.
          Three young married couples were there. Brooks and Lydia, James Ladd and his wife
          Elizabeth, and Samuel Lippincott and his wife who lived in Richmond. She was very young,
          only a child, and he about thirty years of age. Her family would not consent to their
          marriage and they had eloped to Kentucky, were married and re- turned to the " Nixon
          House," where he had fitted up a room. Of course, we had a very loving atmosphere in which
          to breathe. It was there I first saw my future husband. He, being acquainted with my
          brother called to see the bride, and I was introduced to him. He was young and handsome.
          I had no thought of marriage at this time.</p>
        <p>Friends had purchased a farm one mile west of Rich- mond, with an old house partly log
          and partly frame, for the accommodation of Friends who came to attend the Yearly Meeting.
          This farm is now occupied by Earlham College. The horses were turned out to pas- ture. All
          Friends who chose could avail themselves of the use of this farm, for themselves, their
          horses, and conveyances. Many did so, taking provisions with them, straw in their wagons,
          and sleeping in improvised beds on the floor, or in their wagons. All contributed to a
          common fund and were as one family. The women did the work in the house, and the men the
          work out- side, sometimes adding to their other necessary work the killing and dressing of
          beef, hogs, or sheep. Many of them traveled long distances. It was a time of much interest
          to them, and a great treat. There was much monotony in their lives at home. This outing
          was a real change of scene and interest. They enjoyed min- gling with their friends
          socially and religiously. Many valuable friendships were formed, and lasting benefit
          received. The attendance at the Yearly Meeting was very large, especially before Western,
          Iowa, and Kan- sas Yearly meetings were set off as separate Yearly Meetings.</p>
        <p>The Yearly Meeting was held in a large old meeting House known as Whitewater, <note n="4"
            >This venerable "Old Meeting House" was a large two story brick building first occupied
            in an unfinished condition in 1823, and completed in 1837.</note> and continued to be
          held there until it was declared to be unsafe, and in 1878 a new house was built on the
          comer of Fifteenth and Main Streets in Richmond. The old structure was sold for a storage
          warehouse.</p>
        <p>The situation was quite beautiful, being surrounded by a grove of trees. Many Friends
          came in their wagons, and camped in the grove. The Friends at that time were expected, nay
          more, required, to wear the garb known as "plain dress." If they refused they frequently
          were not allowed to remain as Members. The immense crowd presented a very unique
          appearance. Those from the cities, and the richer more cultured of them, dressed richly
          and beautifully, with complete harmony in the color of the dress, gloves and bonnets.
          Others, less favored, were very quaint in dress. There were many young Friends in
          attendance. These came together of afternoons and evenings, taking walks together,
          etc.</p>
        <p>The subject of building a Boarding School was claiming attention, and strong efforts
          were made to bring this to pass. The young people organized for work and assisted toward
          raising money for the completion of the buildings. That was my first work for the
          Church.</p>
        <p>The opportunities for education were very much limited in the Middle "West. Few
          families had libraries. The young people were restrained as with "bit and bridle." The
          limitations built around them were rigid, composed of "thou shalt nots," lest they be
          contam- inated with "the world." The people were true and honest in the convictions, hence
          thev held the reins, with a firm hand.</p>
        <p>It was thought very doubtful propriety for them to stop at a "tavern." There was a query
          read every three months. "Do Friends avoid frequenting Taverns?" Many friends of our
          parents felt much troubled about our exposure. However, the "Nixon House," previously
          referred to, was a very harmless sort of tavern and we escaped without conscious
          injury.</p>
        <p>This was the Autumn of the political campaign in 1842, and Henry Clay had been invited to
          Richmond to address a political meeting, hoping to win the Quakers to his party. He
          stopped at the "Nixon House" and of course was very social, shaking hands with every one.
          When the brides were introduced, he kissed them all. I remember secretly rejoicing that I
          was not a bride. I thought him a very homely man, and not desirable looking enough to have
          him kiss one. We returned home, feeling that the world was much larger than we had
          thought, and from our new experiences we had learned much.</p>
        <p>Brooks and Lydia settled on a farm adjoining the little town of Springboro, Warren
          County, Ohio. Brooks had built a small cottage, painted it white with green window
          shutters, a pretty little home. They were very happy, and came often to see us. Father was
          very fond of Lydia, and we all loved her. Brooks had a close place in the heart of the
          family. There was much going back and forth. Their son was born 4th month 4th, 1844, and
          named John Edward for the two grand- fathers. He was the eldest grandchild in the family
          and a great favorite.</p>
        <p>About this time (1844), the Little Miami Railroad was built from Cincinnati to Xenia. It
          passed through my father's farm. He took a contract for the construction of three miles
          of the road, including that which ran through the "bottom land" of his farm, also a
          contract for building freight and passenger station houses. These were located on his
          farm, and a town site laid off, which he named "Corwin."</p>
        <p>On the completion of the road. Governor Thomas Corwin, Judge George J. Smith, Governor
          Morrow, and Judge Dunlaw of Lebanon, the county seat of Warren County, personal friends
          of my father's, and Mr. William H. Clements, the President of the road, and others, came
          to the opening of the station houses and the railroad. The first train which passed over
          the road from Cincinnati to Corwin, was filled with prominent men, for whom a public
          dinner was served by the citizens of Waynesville and country side. It was a gala day and
          full of interest, for it was the first rail- road train many of us had ever seen. There
          were hun- dreds of people there from the country around, and as many as the cars would
          hold were taken for a short ride.</p>
        <p>In the same year our house was modernized and reconstructed, so as to meet the needs of
          the family. A portico was built over the front door, with six large pillars or columns.
          The house, bam, and all the out- houses and fences surounding were whitewashed. It
          represented a pleasing appearance, as it rested on the high hill, overlooking Waynesville,
          the river, and the hills for many miles around, and the grounds were made beautiful with
          shrubs and flowers. Roses, honey-suckles, evergreens and shade trees were planted. We
          enjoyed this improvement and ice thought it very beautiful. I think so still.</p>
        <p>In the early Autumn of 1844, my brother David married Catherine Carpenter, daughter of
          Nathaniel and Jedidiah Carpenter.</p>
        <p>The Carpenters had removed from Peekskill, N. Y., and settled two miles from Wilmington,
          Ohio. They were very genteel people, and brought with them more culture and refinement
          than many others had, and their influence was uplifting. Catherine and her sister Mary had
          been educated at Westtown Boarding School. We soon became intimately acquainted. David and
          I were very closely attached, being near the same age and hav- ing the same associates. He
          was a loving, helpful brother. His choice of a wife was most congenial. The marriage took
          place at Cincinnati, whither her parents had re- moved from Wilmington a short time
          previous. It was accomplished at Friends' Meeting. I served as one of the bridesmaids with
          Thomas Kite, who was one of the groomsmen. The marriage day proved to be a pleasant one.
          The next day we went by can^age to Waynesville to a reception at our home. It was forty
          miles from Rose Hill, the home of the bride's father. An excellent macadamized road ran
          through a beauti- ful, well-cultivated portion of the State, passing through Sharon and
          Lebanon.</p>
        <p>The young couple spent the Winter at our house, and in the Spring removed into brother
          Joel's house on an adjoining farm. To them were bom eight children, three of whom are
          living, four died unmarried, one, Charles Albert, was married and left a wife and chil-
          dren who reside at Hutchison, Kansas. Brother David died January 4, 1879, full of peace
          and sweetly trusting. Sister Catherine died January SI, 1899. For many years she was
          blind and a great sufferer. She was a noble wife and a noble mother.</p>
        <p>After their marriage I went with them to the Yearly Meeting at Richmond and again stopped
          at the " Nixon House." We had a delightful trip through the country and formed some new
          acquaintances. I again met my future husband, Charles F. Coffin. He and David had
          previously met and corresponded. Charles came to call on the bride, and took us to see the
          Friends' Boarding School, in which we were all interested. I then had no thought of
          marriage with him. I admired him as a cultured gentleman, but my heart was yet free. I was
          very anxious to have a better education, had strong aspirations to do for myself, to
          choose some means of livelihood, some independent course of action. There were then no
          avenues open for women but house- hold service, sewing, or teaching. My mind was on the
          latter.</p>
        <p>There was apparently a very fine opening for me at Hillsboro, Highland County, Ohio, in a
          Young Ladies' Seminary. With the offer came the promise of free tuition, and an assured
          position either as a teacher at home or as a Missionary under the auspices of the
          Congregational Church. This seemed to be an opening in the line I had chosen, but my
          father strongly ob- jected as it would take me from among Friends. As a duty to my parents
          I submitted and gave it up.</p>
        <p>My father employed Elias R. Smith, a very bright young man and a good teacher, to teach a
          Winter school in our house. A room was set apart and fitted up for the purpose. Several of
          the young people of Friends attended. We had an interesting Winter and enjoyed the school.
          I again took up my home duties and labored on cheerfully. Much of the hard work gave way
          to lighter employment, as the country grew more prosperous. Manufacturing
          establishments were opened and the heavier work of preparing goods was transferred to
          machinery, but there were as yet no sewing machines. The shirt- fronts of from forty to
          fifty plaits had to be stitched by hand, also collars and cuffs. Handkerchiefs and ruffles
          were hemstitched. Notwithstanding the improvements there was still much hard work to be
          done. Among other things, butter and cheese were to be made, and forty geese to be picked
          every two months until all the beds were supplied, for every child was given a feather
          bed. The days of mattresses were not yet, and a feather bed was thought to be one of the
          necessaries of life. All this was done by mother and myself. I picked one hundred pounds
          of feathers for myself after the others were supplied.</p>
        <p>My father raised a large number of hogs each year. These were killed, and the product
          cared for at home, candles to be dipped and moulded, as there were no candle factories.
          There were no canned fruits, but all the fruit for winter use was either dried or made
          into preserves and jellies. In the Autumn we made several barrels of sweet apple cider.
          One barrel was boiled down for mince pies, apple butter, etc., the remainder was for
          drinking and making vinegar. In drying apples and making apple butter, the men took part.
          During the day suitable apples were selected and in the evening we all gathered together
          and pared them. Early in the morning the pared apples were put on to cook in large kettles
          with the needful amount of boiled cider. These large kettles were made of bell metal or
          brass. There was a big iron crane fastened in the chimnej^ jamb; on hooks attached to this
          were sus- pended the kettles of apples. They were allowed to cook for several hours. Then
          one of the men stirred it constantly until it was pulverized and thoroughly cooked. This
          apple-butter kept for months and was used for sauce and tarts. In the early part of my
          life, the bread and pies were either baked in a large Dutch oven in large quantities, or
          in an iron oven or skillet which had an iron cover. Coals of fire were put on top and
          underneath. It made sweeter pies than any other process. Mush was made in a kettle hanging
          on a crane over a wood fire. This was hot work. We burned wood altogether. The vegetables
          were cooked in the same way. When stoves were invented for cook- ing, though very heavy
          and cumbersome, they brought great relief. I well remember the first cooking stove I ever
          saw.</p>
        <p>Besides all the labor and the general routine of housework each day, there were garments
          to make, quilting, mending, knitting, etc. I disliked knitting. It was too prosaic,
          tedious and uninteresting, so I always managed to get my aunts to do much of it. I would
          have several stockings on the needles at once, so as to be sure to supply all those who
          wished to knit when visiting us with an apportunity to do so. My aunts were good knitters,
          my Aunt Martha Walker especially. The sisters when they visited each other never took
          their own work, but worked for the one whom they were visiting. So in this way I struggled
          along through my girlhood days without any marked suc- cess in knitting. It is true that I
          was the subject at times of many jokes, remarks and criticisms. These I bore with
          patience, for was I not getting my feet supplied with stockings without being forced to do
          the disagreeable thing .'<note n="5">That John Johnson had as high an ideal of the
            sacredness of the marriage estate and that it was only " to be entered into rever-
            ently, advisably and in the fear of God " there is no question, but his object was that
            his daughter might be fully trained in all matters relative to good housekeeping needful
            for a housewife to know in those days.</note></p>
        <p>It all went smoothly until after a while I began to think about changing my life, and
          asked my father, then suffering from an illness from which he never recovered, if he was
          willing I should encourage Charles Coffin's attentions, with the idea of marriage? He re-
          plied at once "No." When I expressed astonishment, for my father seemed to like Charles
          very much, he re- plied, "It is not Charles Coffin that I object to, but I will never palm
          my daughter off on any man, without her knowing how to do everything that a woman may be
          called upon to do." I was surprised, for I imagined I was full of wisdom and knowledge
          about housework. I inquired what it was in which I was lacking. He said that there were
          two things that I had never learned to do well, knitting and making soap.- My conscience
          said, "Yes, he is right." I at once asked Joel, my second brother, who was sitting by, and
          was always ready to help me in any way, to please go quickly and put up an ash hopper and
          fill it for me, and turning to my sister, who was the champion in knitting stockings I
          said, "Please Phoebe, get the yarn for me and scour it, and when dry wind it for me," to
          which my father, as he lay upon his bed, said "No, neither of them can do so. Joel may do
          the work, but just as thee directs him — thee must direct him. Everything must be ac-
          cording to thy own idea. The stockings and socks must be thine own work. And when thee has
          a barrel of soap as nice as thy mother can make, and a pair of stockings and socks
          completed as well as she could do, thy mother being the judge, I will give my con- sent,
          and thee shall have a father's blessing." I said, "Come Joel, good-bye to the housework
          and every- thing else but the knitting and the soap." I toiled and worked steadily
          Sometimes my conscience would say "help mother" but it was astonishing how little use she
          seemed to have for me ; "I am not needing thee, child," was her response.</p>
        <p>At last I was victorious. What mother had failed to accomplish by her advice, instruction
          and discipline, love made easy and in triumph I bore a sample of work to my father. Some
          of my soap in ono hand, and my stockings and socks in the other, all the family follow-
          ing in procession for all were deeply interested, and several of them had given a little
          advice. In triumph I laid them on his bed, my mother saying as he looked up at her, "They
          are quite equal to anything that I can do." With a loving smile he gave me his blessing,
          "May my darling daughter find in the man she has chosen one in every way worthy of
          her."</p>
        <p>But to return to my narrative from which I have wandered.</p>
        <p>My aspiration, of which I have written, in regard to an education which would fit me for
          teaching, had not been quenched. I availed myself of every opportunity to increase my
          knowledge. I saw that my father's health was failing, and finally in the Autmnn of 1845 he
          consented to my going with Brooks and Lydia to Richmond to attend the Yearly Meeting, and
          if a suit- able place could be found for board, I might remain and attend "Whitewater
          Monthly Meeting School," held in the Friends' School-house. Arrangements were made for me
          after the meeting to board at Sanders Homey's. I knew his wife as she had come from near
          Waynesville. The Yearly Meeting was interesting. I was thrown with Charles F. Coffin a
          good deal in the evenings, and in connection with the "Young Friends' Boarding School
          Association," in which we were both interested.</p>
        <p>At the close of the Yearly Meeting, Brooks and Lydia returned home, and I entered upon my
          school duties. There vicre six boarders, some of them very pleasant persons. Friends were
          very kind to me. There were several small companies made for me, among the first, one by
          Francis and Elizabeth Fletcher who were very kind and to whom I became much attached. The
          school was the leading Friends' School in the Yearly Meeting. It was under the care of a
          com- mittee of Whitewater Monthly Meeting. Our Board- ing-house was an attractive place
          for young people, but I was all absorbed in my studies and cared but little for anything
          else. I had been accustomed to the so- ciety of young people and the attentions of young
          men. I had received offers of marriage, not a few, and some of them my parents thought
          were very suitable, but none of the men came up to the ideal of what my hus- band should
          be. I had respect for all of them, and for some high esteem but no responsive love in my
          heart, an essential requisite in my estimation. My father once said to me that he was
          afraid I would " Go through the cane brake and take up with a crooked stick at last." But,
          praise the Lord, I had no such experience. I got a straight beautiful stick, one who just
          suited my heart and fancy. Charles F. Coffin belonged to our Lyceum, and I was in his
          company frequently. His sister Caroline, who was then a young girl and at- tended school,
          was very kind to me and invited me to their house. Ere long the attachment and interest in
          each other grew unconsciously to us, and so far as I knew, unsought. Our friendship and
          interest was rip- ened into love. We had each found our ideal, a true mate. His frequent
          visits and attention soon became the subject of remark. At this juncture in February,
          1846, I received the intelligence that my dear father whom I had left feeble, was very
          ill, and Nathan Mof- fitt who was engaged to be married to my cousin Rhoda Ann Johnson,
          Uncle James' eldest daughter, was going to Waynesville to visit her and offered to take me
          with him in his buggy. There were no stage-coaches or wagons so I gladly accepted his
          offer and left Richmond thinking I might possibly return.</p>
        <p>I found my father hopelessly ill. He was delighted to see me, and seemed so comforted to
          have me with him, that I at once relinquished all thought of return- ing to school. It was
          a great pleasure to be able to cheer and brighten the remaining months of his life.</p>
        <p>He never murmured nor repined, but patiently bore his sufferings which were intense.
          Charles came to see me the first of April. My father was much pleased to form his
          acquaintance, and gave his approval of the engagement. It was a subject of interest to him
          the remainder of his life. He knew that he must die and made all preparation for it with a
          confidence and acquaintance with God which was most striking.</p>
        <p>He arranged for us all. He made my mother as comfortable as he could and then full of
          faith and a confident assurance of an eternal life, he awaited calmly the coming of the
          Lord. A few days before his death he had a visit from George Carter, David Bailey, Joseph Doane, and Jacob Todhunter, all intimate friends, tried and true. They were a great
          comfort to him. After a season of conversation and prayer they left him, all much affected
          as they knew death was ap- proaching.</p>
        <p>On the morning of June 10th, 1846, after committing his wife and children to Him whom
          he loved, he passed into unconsciousness and in a few hours was forever with his Lord. A
          post-mortem examination re- vealed the fact that his physician had mistaken the disease
          and the remedies were the opposite to what should have been administered.</p>
        <p>The funeral occurred the following day. A large concourse of people attended. He was
          interred in the Friends' Burial Ground.<note n="6">3 Father and mother and brother Joel
            have since been removed and interred in a Cemetery one mile east of Waynesville,
            Ohio.</note></p>
        <p>We returned to our home a sad household. Our circle was broken, the head was gone never
          to return. Our dear mother seemed as if she could not say " Thy will be done." They had
          been one in spirit, one in heart, and one in life. Friends came from miles around to pay
          their last tribute to his life amongst them.</p>
        <p>Brother Brooks and sister Lydia and their little boy fourteen months old, had been with
          us for some time during the last days of my father's life, and now returned to their home
          at Springboro. Brother David and his wife who had lived on an adjoining farm, left in a,
          few months for Cincinnati, where he went into business with his father-in-law.</p>
        <p>It was a great comfort to me to have Charles come to see me a few weeks after my father's
          death. He was straight, erect, with a pleasing face, a good con- versationalist, dressed
          very neatly in strictly Friends' garb. In those days he was very rigid in all the ob-
          servances of the Society and had great veneration for the ^Ministers and Elders of the
          Church. I thought he was the nicest and most lovely man I had ever seen.</p>
        <p>He did not seem to have a flaw in his personality. He is more lovely and dearer to me now
          than he was then.</p>
        <p>My father's death necessitated the disposal of the farm for many reasons. My mother could
          not take care of it. My marriage which was in contemplation would take me from home ; Eli
          and Rachel must be edu- cated. The estate was to be divided and father had arranged for
          brother Joel who owned the adjoining farm, to take our mother with him and have oversight
          of the younger children. It was a sad trial for us all to see our beautiful home go into
          other hands.</p>
        <p>The time for my marriage was arranged for the next Spring. It was a necessity that I
          should stay with my mother for a season, as she leaned on me and looked to me for
          assistance. Those were interesting months, waiting and preparing for the event, but they
          were also sad months. Everything and every place spoke of my father. Everything that had
          not been left to my mother had been sold. The farm was bought by Edward Lynch, an old
          friend of my father's, with our reservation until March, sparing our removal until after
          my marriage. David and Eli were given possession of their property; Joel arranged his
          house for a home for mother, Phoebe, Eli and Rachel. The two youngest needed to be in
          school for some time to come.</p>
        <p>In August, 1846, my cousin, Rhoda Ann Johnson, was married to Nathan Moflitt. Charles F.
          Coffin and I were attendants for them. Charles brought his sis- ter Caroline to visit us,
          whom we were very much enjoyed. The bride and groom left the next day for Richmond,
          Indiana. Nathan Moffitt in a few days afterward took the typhus fever and died in six
          weeks, leaving his bride a young widow.</p>
        <p>Mother's youngest sister, Aunt Rachel Arnett with her husband, came to live for a time
          with my mother. She was a great favorite with us all.</p>
        <p>The home remained in our possession until after my marriage, which took place March 25th,
          18-17. The wedding-day was beautiful. Charles was dressed in a black coat, a light velvet
          vest, and light trousers. His coat was a Friends' coat ; this was the first time he had
          ever had a black coat and it was considered quite an innovation. He had a broad-brimmed
          hat and was the picture of neatness. I was dressed in a cream-colored satin dress, gloves
          and shoes to match, a white bonnet after Friends' pattern, a collar and spencer of tulle
          trimmed with white satin folds. I made all of my out- fit myself.</p>
        <p>We were married at the Friends' Meeting House, in Waynesville. We had "passed" the
          Monthly Meeting the day before in which we had personally "appeared," and declared the "
          continuation of our intention of mamage," and asked for a meeting to be appointed on the
          25th for the accomplishment of the same, which was granted and a Committee was ap- pointed
          to attend the marriage and see that it was "ac- complished according to Friends' order."
          Friends were not required to procure a license to marry, but the Church was held
          responsible for the marriage, and must see that it was accomplished in a proper
          manner.</p>
        <p>Thomas Evans and wife, James Smith and wife of that Meeting, and Dr. Jesse Harvey and
          wife, were appointed the Committee at our request. We rode to the meeting in a buggy, and
          Brooks and his wife fol- lowed in their buggy and sat facing us at the Meeting, my mother
          being by my side and Thomas Arnett by Charles' side; thus the marriage was accomplished. A
          large crowd came as was always the case. The wed- ding party was a small one, none but the
          Committee, William A. Rambo,"<note n="6">Mrs. Rambo was Charles F. Coffin's eldest sister. The marriage certificate, still
            preserved, was read immediately after the marriage ceremony was said.
            </note>and Miriam, and their little son Edward, from Cincinnati,
          and my brothers and sisters were present, for mother could not think of having it
          otherwise. Uncle Thomas and Aunt Rachel had come to spend some time with mother.</p>
        <p>The next morning we left for Richmond, my new home. Brooks and Lydia went with us. At
          this time there were no railroads or stage-coaches, and but very few turn-pikes and
          macadamized roads. The country roads Avere almost impassable. We had to travel sev- eral
          miles to reach the Lebanon and Dayton turnpike. It had snowed the night before and was raw
          and chilly.</p>
        <p>I felt much for my poor mother, leaving her so lonely and sad and obliged to immediately
          vacate the property. Yet I was happy and joyful in my union.</p>
        
        <p>We went to Dayton, and from there stayed at a small hotel at West Alexandria, left there
          at an early hour for Eaton, Preble County, Ohio, where we had a good breakfast, and
          started at 8 a. m. for Richmond, sixteen miles west. The National Road had been com-
          pleted and laid out from Cumberland, Maryland, to Eaton ; the remainder from there to
          Indianapolis had been ploughed up but nothing more. It was a temfic ride and took us eight
          hours.</p>
        <p>We reached Father Coffin's at four in the afternoon, chilled and weary, but when he came
          out of his home to meet us with his genial face, lifted me out, put his aiTns around me,
          kissed me and said "Welcome daughter to a father's heart and home," it warmed me through
          and through. He seemed to take the place of my own dear father. I always loved him after
          that. He took me and introduced me to my husband's mother, who stood in the door with her
          calm sweet face, saying "My dear, this is our new daughter." She was not so demonstrative, but gave me a sweet kiss, and took me to the parlor and introduced me to
          Charles' only brother William, and Sarah his wife, to Cousin S. Francis Fletcher and
          Elizabeth, and Albert Blanchard and his wife, as "our daughter-in-law, Charles' wife."
          That word daughter-in-law went like a cold chill through my heart. She had no thought of
          hurting me: it was the customary mode.</p>
        <p>This experience taught me a lesson, and when in after years my sons brought to me their
          wives, I took them into my heart as daughters and loved them as such, and have never used
          the phrase "daughter-in- law " in connection with them.</p>
        <p>They had provided a nice dinner and we thoroughly enjoyed it. We all went to Meeting the
          next day, and in the afternoon Brooks and Lydia left for home. The door had closed upon my
          past life.</p>

          <p>"It would be well if the members of every Quaker Community could occasionally link
            themselves up with the past and review the lives and deeds, the animating spirit, and
            ideals of the persons who broke the paths which they themselves daily travel." — R. E.
            Jones.</p>
        </epigraph>
        <p>A new era had dawned upon me; a new life with new duties and new relations. A life of
          great respon- sibilities, of hallowed relationships. The past had been a preparation for
          the duties upon which I now entered. When my dear brother and sister had returned to their
          home, I began to realize more fully the entirely new obligations which I had entered upon,
          and the need of adapting myself to the new position. But I had married because I loved
          T^-ith all my heart. Soon the sadness of the leavetaking vanished, and I entered into mj
          new duties and added enjoyments with a happy heart and full of iov and cnladness. In mv
          husband I found one in every way worthy of all my heart could desire.</p>
        <p>He had employed Samuel Cox, a Friend, to go to Waynesville for my household goods. In the
          months of preparation I had secured all things needful for housekeeping, even to my
          laundry tubs and the most minute articles. I set apart for my wardrobe and household
          effects four hundred dollars, of which I had used three hundred and forty dollars, leaving
          a little for any needed additions. Charles had laid by twelve hundred dollars, out of
          which he bought a house of four rooms on a lot of fifty feet with a rough summer kitchen.
          The front room on the first floor was our parlor, which I had furnished with a pretty
          figured car- pet mostly cotton, costing nine dollars and sixty cents; a wooden settee, six
          wooden chairs, a wooden rocking- chair, father's bookcase and a large looking-glass; a
          breakfast table with a dark baize cloth on which was an astral lamp. The other room was
          used for a sit- ting- and dining-room, in which was a rag carpet, a table, a half dozen
          rush-bottom chairs and a nice set of dishes.</p>
        <p>My father had given me on my fifteenth birthday a set of cherry-wood furniture. Charles
          had a bed- room set also, and with these we furnished the two upper chambers. All of the
          rooms except the parlor, had rag carpet, sixty yards of which I had made myself, or rather
          prepared for the weaver.</p>
        <p>When we had all things ready we took up our abode in our new home with great delight.
          Everything was new and we thought that we were fixed very nicely. Charles made and tended
          the garden, sawed and split the wood, and piled it up in the most perfect order, making
          even a woodpile a thing of beauty. I did all the housework.</p>
        <p>We stayed at Father Coffin's a week, until our house-hold goods came and this gave me an
          opportunity of getting acquainted with the family. There were three daughters at home,
          Caroline, Mary, and Hannah Amelia, all young and enthusiastic girls. They entered with
          much interest into all of our arrangements and were much comfort to me. It was a
          delightful life.</p>
        <p>I always regret seeing young people go to boarding when married; they miss so much
          pleasure in work- ing together, making, arranging, accumulating, and the responsibility of
          building up and managing a home.</p>
        <p>The working together unitedly, the sacrifice for each other, the mutual dependence upon
          each other, form a union of strength. The weaning from other associa- tions, which in a
          degree is yery important, the con- centration of the thoughts and the affections of the
          heart on each other, tend to the yielding; together so firmly that no outside party or
          influence can penetrate nor wedge separate. A new life is formed, a double life, and this
          new life and the cares which in their course come upon them, only strengthen and deyelop
          their union and their united powers and they are able to build up a home where God is
          glorified.</p>
        <p>When we entered upon our new life we had no secrets from each other. We consulted
          together as to how much it was desirable to saye out of Charles' salary which had just
          been raised to six hundred dollars, and decided to try and saye half of it. We then set
          apart an amount to be expended for clothing. The remainder of the three hundred dollars
          was for our liyelihood, food and necessary expenses. I was a good cook, knew how to do all
          kinds of work, but had neyer been stinted in the use of materials for cooking, for at my
          father's house we had great abundance of eyerything raised on the fann, and the best quality of milk, cream, butter, honey, etc., so when it
          came to using but one pint of milk a day at a cost of one cent, and all the cream we had
          was what could be taken from this, it is easy to see that I had to learn over again, but
          Charles was so kind as to be easily satisfied ; and I soon learned to prepare the food in
          a delicate manner out of such materials as I could afford, and we really lived quite well.
          I took charge of the finances of the house and adjusted the larder to suit the purse.</p>
        <p>We arose at 5 a. m., Charles made a fire in the stove and put the tea-kettle on; then
          attended to the wood, the yard and the garden as was needful, while I pre- pared
          breakfast. We made it a rule in beginning housekeeping, to always have family worship and
          never vary from it. Charles started to the bank at 6:30 A. M. and I was left alone.</p>
        <p>Everything was done systematically; all the provi- sions were brought in by fanners.
          There were no meat- shops, bakers or grocers. The general merchandise stores kept
          groceries. All had to be purchased from the farmers and we were obliged to take what we
          could get. At the end of the year we had saved three hundred and sixty dollars out of
          the six hundred dollars.</p>
        <p>My daily work was soon done, and then commenced the tedious part. I had nothing to do; I
          sewed for Mother Coffin, helping to make the girls' dresses, etc., and then systematically
          commenced to read all of the Friends' books, of which our library was composed. I did this
          not from inclination but because I thought it a duty. It was weary work; I would read
          until tired, then lie down and take a nap, then go to reading again. I always enjoyed
          reading the Gospels, but never enjoyed reading what men thought of them or their ex-
          planations of what they meant; it was man's ideas of what Christ meant; the Gospels were
          what Christ taught, what He knew of the Father, the Will of God as revealed by Him to us.
          Hence in reading the one I was weary, in reading the other I was refreshed. The one was
          man's thought's, the other, Christ's own revela- tion of God's love and His instruction.
          The works of George Fox and some of the Friends who lived in his time, and others who
          followed after, were considered by many Friends almost sacred, and we were expected to
          receive their teachings without question, to think as they thought, to do as they did, and
          to dress as they dressed. There was no liberty or individual opinion. I had, and have now,
          a peculiar mind. I never could follow closely in a groove laid out by another. I tried
          hard to do so, for I realized that my position: was an important one. The time had come
          when T felt that I had a work to do, that "I must be about my Father's business." I was in
          a position to exert some influence, and it was important that I should act so as to exert
          an influence which should not close the way or in any way hinder the service of either my
          husband or myself. The soul longed for liberty but there was none. I must need follow on
          as our fathers had done or there was no possible chance for useful- ness in the Church.
          The going outside of it for work was not to be thought of. I honestly tried to walk as
          they directed, and to dress as they thought I should dress but it was all an utter
          failure.</p>
        <p>Some years afterward, when in 1872 I was walking in the streets of Jerusalem, I passed by
          a shop where lay a large number of yokes. I had seen the poor women with them on and
          carrying heavy burdens, and my heart was touched with deep sympathy. I picked up one of
          them, put it on my shoulders and had the burden which I had seen one of them carry, hooked
          on to it, and I assayed to do the same. I could not; the yoke was galling, it fretted,
          hurt and rasped me. The burden was heavy and I soon begged to be released. The "yoke
          master" said to me, "You have made a mistake, you have on the wrong yoke. Let me fit one
          on you which is suited to you and adapt the burden to your strength." He did so, attached
          the burden and I could walk away cheerily, for it was adjusted by one who knew how, not by
          another. Had I possessed the courage to rise above my surroundings and claim my liberty in
          Christ to follow Him whither- soever He led, and let Him adjust the yoke on me which he
          had prepared for me, and adjust the burden, my life in its results would have been far
          different. I honestly tried to follow others but I was not in the right place, for I was
          not following Christ. I was not doing the work He would have me do, nor in the way He
          would have me do it. I was not in the niche my Father intended me to fill.</p>
        <p>The old Whitewater Meeting House built many years before, had never been cleaned, though
          thousands had occupied it. <note n="8"> The "Old Meeting House" which is still an
            interesting landmark [1910] was completed in 18:37. It was ceiled inside with natural
            wood unpainted and unvarnished, and seated with heavy wooden benches. For almost a
            generation these had retained the natural dingy wood color. "While no actual filth
            appeared, for it had been regularly swept, it curiously lacked the minute points of
            cleanliness that Mrs. Coffin and her co-workers were awake to see needful. They had the
            merit of making a thorough- going endeavor to Improve its appearance.</note> The large
          gallery used but once a year at the Yearly Meeting was particularly in a bad condition.
          Elizabeth Brown, Rebecca T. Hobbs, Elizabeth Fletcher, myself and one or two others
          decided to clean it. This was my first effort at church work at Richmond. Believing that
          "cleanliness is next to Godliness," we commenced our work, having collected from those
          who were of like mind two dollars, to aid us in the necessary expenditure. John Brown
          brought his horse and wagon, and he and Samuel F. Fletcher helped to carry the large
          ponderous benches, take out the windows, etc.</p>
        <p>It was very hard work but cheerfully we labored, thinking that every one would appreciate
          our efforts. But in this we were mistaken, for many thought it meddlesome. "It has always
          served us thus and why could it not now. It is pride," said one. Another said that we had
          made a great mistake in not asking the Trustees for the privilege, as they were the "sole
          custodians of the property, and no one had any right to invade that house to clean it."
          They protested, but it was too late; the nearest way out was to finish it. One of the dear
          Friends so faithful to his trust J.P., walked back and forth before the house wiping away
          the tears, and when I went to try to comfort him, he said, "water will rot out all the
          sills, and there are them windows, they have never been taken out before, and have never
          let a drop of water in — Rhoda, thee did it, coming here with thy new fangled
          notions."</p>
        <p>I did not feel sorry that I had come, nor that we had progressed so far along with the
          cleaning that they could not stop it, but my first effort was rather disheartening, and my
          first lesson was so effectual that I never undertook that job again. The Church had it
          cleaned yearly after that.</p>
        <p>In our home life we were very happy. Samuel F. Fletcher and wife, who were cousins of
          Charles, were very kind as were many others, and we soon formed a pleasant social
          circle.</p>
        <p>In the Spring we added a new bedroom off our porch, and May 3rd, 1848, there came into
          our hearts and home a new joy, a son, our first-born, a dear little boy, Elijah, named for
          his Grandfather Coffin. He was a beautiful baby and highly prized by both fam- ilies. This
          event was followed by a severe and pro- tracted illness of about eighteen months. I was a
          great sufferer caused by stupid ignorance on the part of my medical advisors. By mistaken
          medical treatment I was tortured and given up as hopelessly ill. My continued illness was
          a great disappointment. I felt intensely the great burden that I was on my husband and his
          family. If it had not been for his loving: kind- ness and constant tender patience and
          care I should have utterly given up. I gave myself as best I could to my Heavenly Father.
          I asked for help, and He gave it. In October of the same year, Charles, with sister Phoebe
          who kindly had come to care for me, took me in a carriage to my mother at Waynesville,
          Ohio, to be under her care, and to receive medical treatment from our old family
          physician. I remained six months, during which I passed though suffering indescribable
          caused by blistering and old-time methods of treatment.</p>
        <p>The doctor brought several consulting physicians, who finally said there was no hope, and
          we went home again, my faithful sister with us. I believed through it all I should get
          well. By the Providence of God I then was placed under the care of one of God's noble men.
          Dr. John T. Plummer, <note n="9"> Dr. John T. Plummer was born in Montgomery County,
            Maryland, 1807. A more devoted worker in his profession, as well as to other relations
            to life, has seldom lived. His benefi- cient career left a deep impression on those who
            knew him which is ever recalled with gratitude and cheerful remembrance. He died at
            Richmond, Indiana, April 10th, 1865.</note> and through his instrumentality I was
          restored to a moderate degree of health, but my strong constitution was shattered.</p>
        <p>For a season we boarded, as household service was so difficult to obtain. When smallpox
          broke out in the room adjoining our own, my sister went home and we went to Father
          Coffin's, our little boy with us. who had grown finely under my sister's care. It seemed
          so sweet to care for my own baby. We remained at Father Coffin's several months until I
          was able to go to house- keeping. Nothing could exceed their kindness to me.</p>
        <p>During this time, in the Autumn of 1819, Indiana Yearly Meeting took place. There I first
          met with Edith Griffith, a Minister from Ohio Yearly Meeting. She was a most remarkable
          woman for that period. She was tall, erect, with strong features, dark complex- ion and
          keen black eyes, and was very sympathetic. A mutual attachment was formed between us which
          con- tinued until her death.</p>
        <p>Harriet Steer was also one of the guests at Father Coffin's. She was a woman of fine
          physique and strong mental endowments, who interested me much, and a very close attachment
          was formed between us. These women who were older than myself, did much in moulding my
          Christian life and character. Rebecca Updegraff was another remarkable woman. All of these
          women were our guests in after years. Harriet Steer for thirty-two 3"ears came to us at
          these Annual Meetings. Rarely has there been and rarely have I met such a combina- tion of
          talented and consecrated women, all Ministers of the Gospel. Their influence over me while
          they lived, was great. One by one they have been gathered home, but I still feel the
          influence of their lives.</p>
        <p>My brother Joel died soon after the Yearly Meeting in 1849. He was a great loss to us
          all, a noble man. I was not able to go to him, and felt his death exceed- ingly. After his
          death brother Brooks disposed of his Springboro Farm, and took Joel's, where he and Lydia
          resided until her death, 12th month, 28th, 1850, leaving a son seven years old, John
          Edward, born Ith month, 4th, 1844, and an infant daughter three weeks old, born 12th
          month, 6th, 1850, whom they named Lucy for Lucy Borroughs, an intimate friend to whom she
          gave the babe. Mrs. Borroughs filled her trust lovingly until the death of her husband
          Joseph Bor- roughs, when she felt that she could no longer care for the child. Several
          arrangements failing, Lucv was placed in a Convent. At my earnest request she was
          withdrawn and lived with us. She was a sweet, loving girl, and ever felt an intense
          longing for a mother's love. As near as possible I gave it to her. I loved her parents
          dearly and we all loved the child for her own sake, and from her own heart she gave us her
          love in return. Her home was with us until she mar- ried Benjamin J. Goodin, a young man
          of excep- tional character who lived in Cincinnati and who proved to be a loving and
          devoted husband. They have be- come earnest Christians, and practical useful members of
          the Episcopal Church, ancl of the community in which they reside. I think she is one of
          the most re- markable women I have ever known, — not strons- in bodv but full of couracre.
          she has risen to everv emer- gency in life. " The heart of her husband doth safely trust
          in her, and her children arise up and call her blessed, her husband also, and he praiseth
          her."</p>
        <p>Since Mrs. Coffin passed away, Lucy B. Goodin died after a brief illness, May 19th,
          1910.</p>
        <p>After my brother Joel's death, my mother with Phoebe, Eli, and Rachel, went to
          Waynesville to live. My Aunt Rachel Arnett resided with her during her husband's absence
          on a Ministerial service in England. Their sojourn was a short one. Aunt Rachel died in
          September, 1850, and my dear mother the same Au- tumn, November 2nd, 1850, both with
          dysentery. Thus in thirteen months four of our most loved and brightest were taken. I was
          so thankful that I was able to be with my mother during a portion of her illness. She was
          so patient, spoke of going home to be forever with the Lord and the loved ones gone
          before. It was a sad time, but amidst it all we were never for- saken, and were supported
          by our Heavenly Father.</p>
        <p>The home was once more broken up. Phoebe went to live with David, and Eli and Rachel to
          Friends' Boarding School.</p>
        <p>Early in the Spring of 1850 we hired a horse and phaeton from William Cheesman, and
          leaving our son Elijah with Mother Coffin, drove through the country to Richmond,
          Jefferson County, Ohio to visit sister Caroline who had married William H. Ladd and
          settled there. Their daughter Ellen was then a sweet baby. We stopped to visit the State
          Institutions at Columbus, the first I had ever seen. The sight of these inmates made me
          very nervous and my sympathies were fully drawn out. We were six days making the jouniey.
          After leaving the National Road we found travelling most difficult; there were no good
          roads. We enjoyed our trip, formed some interesting acquaintances, and returned home
          greatly benefited.</p>
        <p>We found our little boy talking quite nicely through the diligence of Sister Mary, and
          Hannah Amelia.</p>
        <p>The same Spring, 1850, we sold our bridal home and purchased a house and lot on Front
          Street (now South 4th) near Main Street, and our little family began housekeeping again
          with my husband, baby and myself. We were happy and all absorbed in our darling boy who
          developed beautifully.</p>
        <p>On September 1st, 1851, Charles Henry our second son was bom, a bright lovely child. I
          enjoyed in- tensely the privilege of caring for my own babies. Our little family was a
          source of great pleasure. We felt the responsibility and mutually dedicated our chil- dren
          one by one, as they were given, to the Lord. It was a sacred treasure, one for which we
          rejoiced with thanks giving;. Charles Henry was a delicate child and required watchful
          care.</p>
        <p>On October 10th, 1853, another treasure was given, our third son. My sister Rachel was
          then living with us, and she named him Francis Albion. He was a great favorite with her
          and continued to be while she lived. He was a beautiful little fellow, gentle and affec-
          tionate.</p>
        <p>On January 8th, 1856, William Edward our fourth son, came to cheer our hearts. It was a
          bitter cold time. The thermometer stood at 28 degrees below zero with no means of heating
          the rooms but open wood fires, for I could not live in a stove-heated room. We found it
          very difficult to keep him sufficiently warm. He was a bright boy full of energy and life,
          just as Joyfully welcomed as the first. With our boy quar- tette, my hands were full. I
          kept but one servant and she was generally a young girl. I made all of the boys' clothing
          and cared for them myself. It was a pleasure to care for, train and develop them.</p>
        <p>In 1858, leaving our boys with my sister Phoebe, we went East, my first trip, going by
          way of Niagara Falls, we spent several days at Montreal. We w^ere dressed in Friends'
          costume and attracted much atten- tion as we walked the streets. The city is largely Roman
          Catholic, and, as it afterwards appeared, they thought we were a new order of Priests and
          Nuns. We visited all the places of interest, then by way of Lake George and Lake
          Champlain, to Boston, stopping at the Revere House. We saw everything there of pub- lic
          interest. By invitation we went to Lynn, Massa- chusetts, guests of Charles F. and Maria
          Coffin. Most sweetly were we received in their lovely home. We spent several days with
          them, extending our acquaint- ances, many of whom we had entertained at our house. Nathan
          and Mary Breed and their interesting family, Samuel and Eliza Boyce, William Boyce and
          wife, Isaac Bassett and family, Micajah Pratt and family, and many others were added to
          our list of friends. To us it was a great feast as it was a charming circle, all persons
          of wealth and much culture.</p>
        <p>We also went to Providence, Rhode Island. Here we became much interested in Friends'
          Boarding School, and formed other new acquaintances, among them Dr. Toby and family, rich,
          accomplished and most attractive Friends, Benjamin Buffum and his wife, and others "who
          have since been our life-long; friends.</p>
        <p>While in New York we were the cmests of David and Paulina Sands, whom we had also
          entertained at our house. This was a most interesting" family. David Sands was a man of
          wealth and far ahead of the spirit of the times. His family were interested in his works
          of philanthropy and benevolence. His daughter Mar- tha, who afterwards married Lindlay
          Murray Ferris, and Anna, a beautiful girl, who afterwards married Edward Payson Roe, the
          author, were much engaged in their work among the poor in "Five Points," then the lowest
          slums. We stayed with them a week and went with David Sands to the Hospital for the
          Insane, to the Tombs, and to visit various kinds of philan- thropic work. We saw much and
          tried to learn our lessons well, and as we look back we remember their Christian
          hospitality and their devotion to the cause of Christ, with fond memories.</p>
        <p>We formed the acquaintance of William and ]\Iary Wood, William Cromwell and family,
          Edward Marshall and wife, and many others. In Philadelphia, we were the guests of Isaac
          and Rebecca Collins, and went with them to many of the noble institutions; the Houses of
          Refuge, of Correction, and other public charities im- pressed us deeply. With Rebecca
          Collins we visited the Eastern Penitentiary, and our interest began through her in work
          for the improvement of prisons. Dur- ing this visit we laid the foundation for our after
          life service. Nothing we had ever learned before had such an effect upon us and on our
          future lives. The ex- ample of these persons of wealth, of their devotion, and their
          manner of service, was of infinite value to us. They have all gone from earth, but the
          influence of their lives affects the lives of others and still remains with us.</p>
        <p>The notable event of 1858 was the birth of our little daughter on the third of August.
          She brought with her sunshine and joy. We named her Mary Amelia and dedicated her to God.
          She was a great treasure, beautiful, gentle and loving in her disposition.<note n="10"> For
            further account of this dear child see Chapter VII, page 104.</note></p>

        <p>My health now in a measure restored, I felt that I should do something for others. No way
          seemed open that met mj desires. I searched my Bible and soon settled it in my own mind,
          that if I followed Christ I must of necessity live as He lived, and as I traced His life,
          I learned that it was spent for the bodies and souls of men, that He was occupied in doing
          good, helping the poor, visiting the sick, comforting those in sorrow, lightening the
          burdens and increasing the joys of the world. There were at that time few poor families in
          Richmond. These I sought out and aided.</p>
        <p>For some years I served as a member of the "Com- mittee on Education" of the Friends'
          School at Rich- mond; the duties were to select teachers and look after the method of
          instruction. When the High School of the public school system was established. Father Cof-
          fin, Esther Hadley and myself were appointed by the city as "Visitors and Inspectors" of
          the conduct of the School. We were given a good deal of power. At first this work was very
          interesting; after a few years the serv'ice was done away with.</p>
        <p>Literature of any kind was very scarce in the town and country districts ; private
          libraries were rare, and public libraries, few and limited in the supply.</p>
        <p>The Friends' Book and Tract Committee, of which work Father Coffin and Charles were among
          the leaders, was established.<note n="11">The " Book and Tract Committee " was organized
            5th month 30th, 1850.</note></p>
        <p>I was a member of this Committee thirty years. In the work I entered with zeal and
          interest. It supplied many Friends with valuable additions to their libraries, and added
          to the Monthly Meeting Libraries. To bring; some readino; matter more directly to
          individuals, tracts on different subjects were either published or purchased and supplied
          gratuitously to all who would accept. To accomplish this successfully many persons went
          from house to house offering them, and invariably found a welcome response. Mother Coffin,
          Elizabeth Brown and I, went with a supply to Eaton, the county seat of Preble County,
          Ohio, and visited all the fam- ilies and distributed tracts. This, we learned from one of
          the ministers of the Methodist Church, was the beginning of a great revival of religious
          life in the town, bringing many to a knowledge of Christ.</p>
        <p>We then visited Westville, Boston and Abington. We went twice to Centrevillc, the county
          seat of Wayne County, Indiana. The last time we went to Centre- ville, we found a man in
          the last stage of life, who said he had been praying for us and longed to see us, to tell
          us of the great light that had come into his soul as the result of our former visit. We
          went to a county jail, a one-story building with no windows, no light excepting when the
          door was open. We were warned against going in as the inmates were "terribly hard." When
          we entered, it was so dark that we could not see anyone, until our eyes became accustomed
          to it. There were eleven men. No ventilation, seats or beds; nothing but the bare floor.
          They received us kindly, listened attentively and joined in the singing led by Elizabeth
          Ham, a sweet singer and a noble Christian woman. There was one man whom they called "Dan
          Rice," who, after we left, gave them my discourse almost word for word. This was sure
          evidence to the critics that our efforts were useless, but we were certain of one thing,
          that the message had entered his mind, and we believed that it would find an entrance into
          his soul. "The entrance of Thy word, it giveth light."</p>
        <p>With Father Coffin I went several times over the same grounds, examining into the supply
          of Bibles and distributing them. We were members of the Bible Society. Father and Charles
          were life members of the American Bible Society. By these two organizations we were able
          to supply many destitute families.</p>
        <p>About this time a "Reading Circle" <note n="12">The reading Circle was organized December
            14th, 1858.</note> was formed at our house for the purpose of systematic reading of
          Biographical and Historical Works principally. Some other books were read. The "Circle"
          was composed largely of the younger Friends, John Nicholson and wife, Elwood Hadley and
          wife, Sister Rachel, and many still younger. This was kept up for several years and the
          books were circulated amongst its members. The Circle afterwards met at different
          homes.</p>
        <p>A Bible Class was formed later for the study of the Bible ; this was also held at
          different houses. It was useful to all and was also continued for several years.</p>
        <p>Soon after my marriage I was appointed a teacher in Friends' Sabbath School at
          Whitewater. My pupils were young women. I was illy prepared and often thought — " poor
          things, it must be most stupid," but they seemed to endure it patiently.</p>
        <p>I was afterward given a class of small children of Friends, the parents of whom were
          interested in various classes of the school. They were little " duckies," sweet and
          attractive, but could not read, and I was ut- terly at sea to know what to do with them. I
          con- cluded to teach or talk to them as I did to my own boys at home and made a great
          success of it. I had ten girls who remained with me for eleven years, until they were all
          Christians, and then all taught classes. Others came and went, but these remained. Later
          Charles Henry was added, and Clayton Hunt's twins, Joshua and Benjamin, and one day Hulda
          Estes, a dear friend of mine, brought to me her youngest son, Rowland Estes, saying " Do
          take my boy ; no one will have him. I can't find a place for the sole of his feet to rest
          upon. I must give up my class if thee don't take him; he is not at all interesting."</p>
        <p>I took him into the class ; he was a little fellow, well taught for his age, and I never
          had a more attentive scholar, so loving and grateful. AMien he came to manhood he was a
          warm-hearted Christian gentleman. He was elected Superintendent of the Bible School, and
          one day sent for me and asked me to open his school with prayer. As he introduced me, he
          said " She took me in ; she led me to Christ."</p>
        <p>At one time I offered a reward of a nice Bible for the scholar who would learn the
          "Sermon on the Mount " by a certain time. I went to the school with the reward, and when
          all of them arose and repeated the whole sermon, word for word without any mistakes I was
          totally unprepared, but Father Coffin, who was Superintendent, aided me through the Bible
          Society to keep my promise.</p>
        <p>Thus far I had never offered prayer outside of my family Frequently when I went around on
          different missions of love, I felt I should pray, but returned home, feeling that I had
          failed to accomplish what I was shown should be done. It was an untried field of
          experience to me. The bonds of habit were strong. Prayer in those days, excepting silent
          prayer, was looked upon, and I was taught to consider it as an awful thing. This was
          contrary to my ideas of vocal prayer. Talking to my Heavenly Father — "an awful thing " —
          seemed absurd, but that feeling had somehow gi'own too generally in the Church. <note
            n="13">In the fifty years or more that have elapsed since the times of which Mrs. Coffin
            here writes, there has been a great reaction in the practice of vocal prayer in the
            public assemblies of the Society of Friends.</note> I had been taught reverence for the
          Church, and it was hard to surmount the influences. Finally one day, while engaged in my
          household duties, the Spirit's call came pressing upon</p>
        <p>Prayer has, since the rise of the Society, been its distinctive principle and practice
          and considered indispensable. It has ever held faithfully in accord with St. Augustine's
          teaching: "Thou, Lord, has communicated thyself to all: Thou teachest the heart without
          wotds; Thou speakest to it without articulate sounds; and as a body has declared and
          believed in the constant communion with God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ whether
          uttered or unexpressed."</p>
        <p>Though there was perfect liberty for all present to take part in their meetings for
          worship, there had in the long years grown a strange feeling of restraint from its public
          vocal utter- ance — except perhaps by the regularly appointed ministers — the conception
          being that to approach God the Father, the In- finite and Eternal, was an act of profound
          and deep reverence, almost beyond the imiDcrfect and insufficient expression of human
          lips. The result was such an overawing sense of fear and humbleness that few of the
          younger members had the physical courage to encounter the duty. This spirit of awe
          expressed in the well-known lines of the self-abasing Watts: "Before Jehovah's awful
          Throne" prevailed in many parts of the Society.</p>
        <p>The "Declaration of Faith" as given in the ruling "Book of Discipline of the New York
          Yearly Meeting" declares as follows:</p>
        <p>"Without prayer there can be no acceptable worship. It is therefore incumbent upon all
          Christians, in their meetings es- pecially, to seek after Divine help, to offer spiritual
          sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. Vocal prayer uttered in response to the
          promptings of the Holy Spirit is an important part of public worship; and whenever God's
          people meet together in His name, they should reverently seek unto Him in united prayer.
          We would encourage parents and heads of families to be faithful in the exercise of this
          privilege before their children and households."</p>
        <p>me with unusual force. I had prayed for power to do my whole duty as a loving service to
          my Father. I stopped, and putting on my wraps, went to the house where I felt I should go.
          The woman seemed yery glad to see me. In a few moments I told her that I wished to read a
          short portion of God's word and offer prayer. "Most certainly," she said, "I shall be so
          glad to have you. I have been wishing some one would come and do so. I am not a Christian
          but I want to be one." She accepted Christ and became a very devoted Chris- tian. I went
          home happy: I had learned my lesson.</p>
        <p>In conversation with Father Coffin, with whom I could always talk, he said, "Daughter,
          follow the leading of the Spirit without regard to the past or the result in the future.
          It is ours to obey, and the results be- long to the Lord." This I have carried out. He and
          I were appointed by the Bible Society to go from house to house inquiring as to the number
          of persons with- out a Bible. We found a large number of families without the Holy
          Scriptures: these we supplied. One family had never had a copy of the Bible or read it.
          They received it gladly, read it together evenings when they had spare time, and also to
          their friends when they came in. They were perfectly absorbed in the "Old, old story of
          Jesus and His love." The Lord gave his blessing upon the work.</p>
        <p>As time advanced the population of Richmond grew, and with it poverty increased and the
          needs multiplied the avenues and opportunities for Christian work. Christian work: What is
          it. It embraces a large scope — the work of Christ. We are apt to look at it as entirely
          outside of ourselves. In reality it is an in- ward work of grace wrought in the heart by
          Christ, and changing the nature, purifying the affections and the desires, flowing out to
          the world in a pure life and bearing fruit for the people. The heart having been changed,
          the fruits are love toward God and toward man. Thus our lives, our w^ords and our acts,
          call others " to come and see that the Lord is good," re- sulting in ministry to the
          suffering, mentally, physi- cally, spiritually and financially, amongst the rich and the
          poor, the high and the low, as the needs require and the ability is given, always in the
          sympathy, spirit, and patience which Christ so eminently showed forth in His life. In
          short to do as He did, to live as He lived. This is Christ-like work.</p>
        <p>The relation of husband and wife is the most God- like relation that there is. No
          so-called Christian work should ever be allowed to interfere with the relation of or
          duties as husband and wife to each other and this is extended to the family relation,
          which is God-or- dained, entered into by our own free will and choice. I say without
          hesitation that Christ never calls either man or woman to any service which would militate
          against the training or development of their children. But by proper system and
          arrangement of home and its duties, with an ear open to hear the voice of God, a heart
          full of love, and open to the needs of others, there are opportunities for living as
          Christ did for others, and a work may be carried on far more powerful, more productive of
          good, than much of the so-called Christian work which is now being done. The ways and
          opportunities lie all along our path. It is "What- soever thy hands find to do" — a
          pleasant smile — a grasp of the hand, a cordial greeting.</p>
        <p>One day there came to our door three little children. It was a cold, drizzling day, with
          snow on the ground. Their little toes were out and they were thinly clad. Some one had
          sent them to me. I went with them to their home and found great poverty, no food, no fire,
          and the mother ill with lung fever. They had been long fasting. She told me that one day
          she had been sorely tempted to take the lives of herself and children, her husband, having
          gone into the war as a soldier, was killed, and she had struggled along- until all was
          gone. I supplied their needs of food, clothing and fire, secured a physician and had her
          nursed. It was no time for teaching. The physical needs were too great. I went into that
          house with a bright, cheerful face when all this was done. The next day I sat down bv the
          side of her bed and asked of her relation to God. She sweetly said, "Yesterday I gave my
          heart to God. It was your cheerful, bright face that won me to Him." All this was done
          without any neglect of duty at home. It only took a little time, a little self-denial and
          self- sacrifice.</p>
        <p>One day in walking along in the sleet and rain, the sidewalks covered with ice, I passed
          a little boy carry- ing a basket of eggs. Just as I passed he fell; I stopped, picked up
          the eggs which had rolled away, wiped the tears off his face and then said, "Let me carry
          the basket, and give me your hand. I will help you along." He refused his basket, but took
          hold of my finger, too self-reliant to let me aid him. He was relying on his own strength
          and not on mine, and soon he fell again, this time breaking some of the eggs and hurting
          his knees. At last he yielded, gave me the basket, and taking my hand said, "Won't you
          please hold me tight. Madam? " Cheerily we chatted on the way, and by the time we reached
          his home all trace of grief was gone, and I was able to so fully explain as to save the
          boy punishment. It was only a little deed of kindness, but I had won the boy's heart,
          spared him unjust punishment, and learned for myself one of the sweetest lessons of life,
          viz., when in trouble and sor- row to look to Christ for help and yielding to Him fully,
          to commune with Him, and let Him, help me. It has saved me many troubles.</p>
        <p>In the retrospect of our lives I recognize that the entertainment of strangers and those
          engaged in reli- gious work, has brought to us and to our children a rich fruitage. Our
          house was the home for many dis- tinguished persons who came to Richmond. The influ- ence
          of their lives upon us and upon our children was very great. Being thus brought in contact
          with men and women who had cultivated their higher natures, their larger experience and
          knowledge broadened our lives, expanded our thoughts, increased our powers, and thus
          prepared us for the work which was before us.</p>

        </epigraph>
        <p>The Society of Friends after many, many years of vitalizing active service, in which they
          bore a strong testimony for spiritual worship and against formalism, had, through this
          protesting against formalism in other churches, become very formal. While there were many
          able, conscientious Christians here and there, striving to serve the Lord in the way they
          thought right, the Church as a whole had lost much of. its vitality. As is always the
          case, so was it now — strik- ingly so — while engaged in finding fault with what others
          were doing, criticising, judging and protest- ing, the life was sapped by a system of
          quenching and "thou shalt nots." The younger people had no means of showing their love to
          God by any active service. They were required to use certain modes of dress and language,
          abstain from all relaxations and amusements ; music and singing were prohibited. Even
          singing a hymn at home was very doubtful, not to be encouraged, an evidence of "creaturely
          activity" of which there was great fear. It was a narrow path, a "guarded education," but
          the guards were so strong and high that the breathing of the pure air of contact with
          other Christians was ahnost shut off. The pure flow of Christ-like thought was obstructed
          by repression. The rehgious instruction was not such as we now receive, the freedom to
          participate in any worship was not en- couraged. There were many hungering and thirsting
          for the water of life, but few to give it. It was, how- ever, soon to flow freely.</p>
        <p>At the beginning of the Yearly Meeting of 1860 a company met at our house to consult as
          to what should be done, or rather what could be done. Father and Mother Coffin, Harriet
          Steer, John Henry Douglas and ourselves met in our library. We were joined by Murray
          Shipley and Dr. David Judkins, and after a season of prayer and consultation we decided to
          send a written request to the Yearly Meeting for the privi- lege of holding an evening
          meeting for sacred worship in the "Old" Whitewater Meeting House for those in the younger
          walks of life. This proposal met with much opposition, but was finally granted. It was the
          understanding that the recommended ministers should refrain from preaching, we fearing
          that the time would be monopolized by the ministers and our purpose frus- trated. We were
          very curious about how many young people would attend and various estimates of the prob-
          able attendance were made. Few of us had sufficient faith in the power of God's Spirit and
          the fullness of God's love. We Avent early, after a season of prayer, and found that the
          Meeting House was filled with the exception of a few empty seats in the gallery. It was
          estimated that a thousand persons were present. <note n="14">This remarkable meeting was
            held on the 7th of October, 1860. Elijah Coffin records in his journal that there were
            "not less than two thousand present, a memorable time."</note></p>
        <p>The solemnity of the Meeting could only be felt — it could not be written : there was no
          form, no leader. The young people were told the purpose of the Meeting and that it was
          theirs. Murray Shipley, Dr. Dayid Judkins, Charles and myself spoke for the first time
          publicly, ayowing our allegiance to Christ. When we were arranging for the Meeting, I knew
          that it would be my privilege to own my Lord, and publicly to enlist in His service. When
          I declared that I was on the Lord's side, that I was His, and He was my Saviour; and
          repeated the text, "Let others do as they may, I will seiwe the Lord," I was loosed and
          set free, and I came out of that Meeting with a heart full of love to God, and a spirit to
          do His will.</p>
        <p>Hundreds gave their first testimony for Christ or offered their first public prayer.
          There was no confu- sion, no haste, no urging or calling on anyone to speak. The Lord was
          working with great power, and when the Meeting closed, we were all astonished when told
          that it was 1.30 o'clock in the morning.</p>
        <p>After the Yearly Meeting closed, Sybil Jones, a minister from Maine who was present at
          the young people's meeting, had a wish to see those who had taken a part. We invited them
          to our house and on the next Sabbath evening, one hundred and fifty came.</p>

        <p>Our drawing-room, library, and hall were filled. It was a most interesting- meeting. We
          invited them all to come again on each Sabbath evening, and for more than four years our
          home was opened every week and large numbers attended. The Meetings proved a great
          blessing not only to us and those who were with us, but throughout the Society of Friends.
          It may seem strange that there should have been anything but great rejoicing at these
          Meetings, but such was not the case. Many honest good people felt that it was contrary to
          discipline to hold a meeting without the sanction of the Church. We met with much
          opposition from the Church Officials which gave many of our valued friends much cause for
          uneasiness.</p>
        <p>Individual liberty to worship God in our own house, without let or hindrance, was a right
          established in England, and fought for by our Early Friends. It was a "Common Law" that a
          "Man's house was his Castle," not to be interfered with, or his acts therein. It was that
          law which caused our Early Friends to put a family in every meeting house, and there their
          perse- cutors could not reach them. Many of the Friends' Meeting Houses have a family now
          living in them. It was this right or freedom of worship for which we were contending. Many
          Friends came to see us to persuade us to give up the Prayer Meeting, but all who attended
          advised us to continue. The difference was an unpleas- ant one, but "victory perched upon
          our banners." During the Yearly Meeting in 1861, previous to ou Father Coffin's death,
          although very feeble, he felt he had a message for that body. He was taken to the Meeting
          House and made a most earnest plea for the liberty of holding Prayer Meetings. All who
          heard him felt that it was his dying effort, and as he stood before them so feeble and
          emaciated, and pleaded so earnestly, he won every heart. His address was incor- porated in
          the "Minute on the State of Society," which as usual was sent to all of the subordinate
          Meetings.</p>
        <p>This Prayer Meeting was the first one of which we have any knowledge of having been
          regularly held among Friends. Very soon they were started in other Meetings and are now
          almost universal. Out of this Prayer Meeting grew what is now known as "Eighth Street
          Friends' Meeting in Richmond," the result of that wonderful Meeting in the Autumn of 1860.
          The Spirit of God was working amongst the people. There were many Friends who did not
          unite with us, some of them were our dearest friends. It was most painful to wound them,
          and at one time so great was the oppo- sition and so severe the pressure, that after a
          night of suffering near the break of day, I fell asleep and dreamed a dream that was of
          oo-eat comfort. I di'eamed that I was standing on the west side of our house near a
          window, looking at a coming storm. The cloud was exceedincrly black and fearful to see. I
          could see the forked lightning, and hear the wind in its fury, and when strangely
          impressed that there was great dan- ger, in my dream I fell upon my knees and in gi'eat
          fear called upon God to deliver me. Immediately in the west there arose a form like unto a
          man glorious to look upon and with outstretched hands parted the clouds asunder and there
          burst forth the clear shining of the sun. I awoke, I had been asleep but a few min- utes ;
          but with peace and quiet confidence in my soul, and the impression strongly upon my niind
          that the dream had been given to strengthen and comfort me. At any rate such was the
          result.</p>
        <p>The results of the Prayer Meeting followed by other work extended widely to the Society
          of Friends, and carried progressive development of life and interest throughout all of the
          organizations of the Society. The manifestations and degrees of vitality were more or less
          varied in the separate localities.</p>
        <p>About this time Mrs. Cofiin frequently ad- dressed the public meetings for worship,
          speak- ing in a quiet unaffected manner and in a natural tone of voice. In the year 1867
          the ilMonthly Business Meeting " acknowledged her gift of ministry," and placed her on
          record, a ^Minister of the Gospel. From that time on- ward she preached the Gospel in many
          parts of the United States, in England, on the Continent, and in the Orient.</p>
        <p>In Richmond, of those who had received the com- mand, " Let your lights so shine," and
          joyfully ac- cepted the commission, it resulted in the establishment of a new meeting- for
          worship and Preparative of like- spirit.</p>
        <p>A vacant church building was rented and all with one accord and one mind joined in the
          work. The Prayer Meeting, which for four years had met at our house, still continued, and
          in 1864 was attached to the regular Meeting and became a part of it. In these Meetings
          there was the greatest freedom and liberty of action, "to do what our hands found to do" —
          Sabbath Schools, Bible Classes, Reading Circles which met at different homes, Tracts and
          Tract Readings, Cottage Prayer Meetings <note n="15">
            <p> The name of this meeting is now "South Eighth Street Monthly Meeting" [1910.]</p>
            <p>The Richmond Preparative ^Meeting was organized in the First month of 1865. It was an
              offshoot of a prayer meeting, com- menced in a private house, that of Charles F.
              Coffin, in the year 1860, which was probably the first meeting for that specific
              object among Friends. The meeting-house at the corner of Sixth and South B streets,
              now occupied by the A. M. E. Church, was used for nearly three years. The ground for
              the present house, on Eighth street, was bought at once, and the building completed
              and occupied in 1867. It is a generally conceded fact, that this meeting was in the
              van of the areat evangelistic movement that has so changed the aims and methods in
              Friends' Church during the last tw-enty-five years. It was in the prayer- meeting of
              this church that the memorable revival of 1869 commenced. It was one of the first, if
              not the very first, of such meetings among latter-day Friends. The meetings were
              largely attended, the house being frequently filled. Many persons (about 400) were
              brought to accept Christ as their Saviour — among them some of the most active and
              useful members of the church at this time. From " The Annual Visitor," 1890.</p>
            <p>In seventh month, 1866, the heirs of Elijah Coffin presented to this meeting 201
              volumes of Friends' books for a library</p>
            <p>3 There followed a general sacred impulse towards Missionary work. The "Friends'
              Foreign Missionary Association" was or- ganized in the year 1871. Within the short
              period of three years, eight missionaries had entered foreign mission fields, and were
              encountering every difficulty that new conditions brought in the unfamiliar language
              and environments. The Third Annual Re- port of the Association dated "10th month, 5th,
              1874," states that Louis and Sarah Street were then on their way to Mada- gascar;
              Micajah C. Bin ford and lus wife had gone "12th month, 1873," to Matimoras, Mexico;
              Samuel Purdie and his wife Gulielma M. Purdie, were "efficiently laboring in another
              Mexican field;" and Hanah and Irene Beard were actively engaged in a broad mission
              field.</p>
            <p>The Association united in asking Indiana Yearly Meeting to adopt the work as one of
              its permanent branches of evangelizing labor. The proposition met with cordial favor
              and the foreign work was put in charge of a Standing Committee the members of which
              had been active in founding the organization.</p>
            <p>The names of the committee were: Charles F. Coffin, Francis W. Thomas, Micajah C.
              Binford, Elkanah Beard, Murray Shipley, Elizabeth B. Hopkins, Rhoda M. Coffin, Mary J.
              TayloT, Harriet Steer, and Irene Beard.</p>
            <p>See the historical paper "Rise of Foreign Missions among Friends," page
            221.</p></note>, etc. The missionary spirit was soon apparent : our Friends desired that
          the Gospel should be carried to those who sat in darkness. Louis and Sarah Street, members
          of our Meeting, felt called upon to go to Madagascar where they labored most successfully
          for twelve years. This was like the leaven. The influence was felt and resulted in many
          others going out in different directions, in different places, and finally in the
          establishment of the Foreign Mission work in which American Friends are now engaged.^</p>
        <p>Prayer was offered night and day for direction, for guidance in the spiritual upheaval
          which soon followed.</p>

        <p>The Prayer Meeting became the center of great activi- ties. A great revival came upon us.
          For six months this Church was the recipient of great gi-ace, hundreds were brought to a
          full acceptance of new life. Three hundred and seventy-five were added to the Church. The
          revival spread all over the city. It was a time of great favor from the Lord. This Church
          is still a strong power.^ Many who were then converted are now its strongest workers. It
          Is Impossible to give any accurate Idea of the result of that blessing.</p>
        <p>We had many strong Friends who advocated free- dom of action. Father and Mother Coffin
          from the beginning sustained us by their presence and prayers — Joseph and Esther
          Dickinson, Samuel F. Fletcher and Elizabeth, and many others. Many young people faithful
          and time to a place where they had found the way of life, followed out the results of the
          Prayer Meet- ing. Among the older Friends were Elizabeth Ham, a woman of unusual strength
          of character, a very spirit- ually minded woman, and an intimate friend with whom I was
          afterwards closely associated in philanthropic work. James and Sarah J. Smith, he a quiet,
          steadfast Friend with good judgment, she one of the noblest of women possessing much
          ability, a minister, very strong in prayer and in spiritual life. I was very closely asso-
          ciated with her In many kinds of Christian and benevo- lent work. I went with her
          afterwards on a religious visit to the members of Chicago Meeting. We visited all of the
          families of Friends and the public institutions in that city with interest to ourselves
          and I trust profit to all. We went to the Cook County Jail and had a meeting with the
          prisoners. This was the first time I had ever seen a murderer and there went through me a
          thrill of hon^or. The man had killed his wife. He listened closely and seemed touched. In
          the women's department we met with a murderess who had killed her paramour. Sarah Smith's
          conversation and prayer with this woman were the most touching I ever listened to. An
          account of it was written for a Friends' paper edited by Eli and Mahala Jay.</p>
        <p>When Charles and a few Friends with him were work- ing to get a bill through the Indiana
          State Legislature for the establishment of a Reformed School for Boys, I went with him to
          Indianapolis. We took a room at the "Bates House," the Republican Headquarters, and I
          spent my time in the hotel lobbying for the bill, which was carried and passed in 1867.
          The school eventually was established. Charles was made President of the Board of
          Managers, and for several years he put much of his energy and strength into that cause. It
          became a most successful institution.</p>
        <p>While at Indianapolis a number of the citizens called upon me, among whom were James Ray
          and Stoughton Fletcher, Junr., both of whom were afterwards active in establishing the
          Women's Reforaiatory, to consult as to the founding a Home for Friendless Women and Girls
          in that city, and the possibility of having me to arrange it for them. This I declined,
          but recommended</p>
        <p>88</p>
        <p>Reminiscences</p>
        <p>them to secure the services of Sarah J. Smith, who with her husband resided near Milton,
          Wayne County, Ind. I knew she was very competent to organize and put the institution into
          working order. This resulted in her permanent employment. This was the begin- ning of
          Sarah Smith's work of that character; she met with great success and remained with the
          Home until she left it for the larger work, "A State Reformatory for Women and Girls."</p>

        <p>On the 28th of October, 1871, we left our home for a journey abroad to be absent several
          months. Our son Elijah was married and residing in his own home, Charles Henry had charge
          of the business, William Edward was at Providence Boarding School, Percival Brooks, our
          youngest son, was left in the care of our sister, Caroline E. Ladd, in Brooklyn, N. Y.,
          who kindly offered to care for him. He was too young to take with us, and we were most
          fortunate in so good a caretaker. Our son Francis went with us, a most en- joyable
          companion. We had a stormy passage. The approach to Ireland was beautiful. On landing we
          were met with an Invitation to Ebenezer Pike's of Cork. He was absent from home, but his
          lovely wife with her Interesting family were most cordial. It was our first experience In
          Irish life. We were detained at Cork and on Spike's Island, inspecting the prison system,
          and it was quite late when we arrived. It was pouring rain. They had given us up and were
          at dinner, but we soon felt quite at ease, and entered on our work of inspect- ing
          prisons, houses of refuge, and attending some of the Meetings.</p>
        <p>We spent three days thus, then to see Blarney Castle and the Lakes of Killarney, all and
          everything so new. We were pleased with the cheery appearance and green grass. Many of the
          peasantry lived in little huts, some with the pig and baby most friendly, others with the
          cow partaking of the warm hospitality or faithful old hens brooding over the eggs which
          they were very certain would bring forth a lively brood, whilst the muck heap was at the
          door of the windowless cottage.</p>
        <p>We went on to Dublin, where we were most warmly welcomed by Samuel Bewley, whom we had
          entertained at our home, and his lovely family. Many friends called to see us and invited
          us to their homes to partake of their genuine hospitality. We mingled with them in their
          Mission Work, and held services as way opened. We then crossed the Channel to Chester, an
          old walled town, the first we had seen, and which was intensely in- teresting to us. We
          spent the day in Chester going around the walls and to the ancient historic places. In the
          evening we left for Leominster, accepting an invi- tation from Henry Stanley Newman and
          his dear wife and their lovely family. Here we remained several days. We addressed several
          meetings and were made a bless- ing to some. We then went to Wales. A great re- vival had
          been going on for months at Newport in which all church or class distinctions had vanished
          be- fore the Mighty Spirit of God, all denominations join- ing together, the ministers of
          each denomination tak- ing turns in conducting the meetings. One Friend, rather a
          prominent man, was actively engaged in the work and had invited us to take the "Friends"
          even- ing, as we had just come from the great revival at Richmond, Indiana. English
          Friends were not as yet, they thought, equal to it. The meeting was very large and that
          evening there was a wonderful manifestation of God's loving power. Many accepted Christ.
          It was 11 p.m. when the meeting was closed. At their earnest request we appointed a
          meeting at eight the next morning. We returned to Alfred Bland's, whose guests we were. A
          large number had preceded us, and we all sat down to an English supper at twelve o'clock
          midnight, and arose from the table at two o'clock a. m. — two hours later — having had a
          real Lord's Supper. We arose next morning in time for the early morning meet- ing, which
          proved a most interesting occasion.</p>
        <p>I afterwards received a letter from a vicar of the Church of England, thanking me for the
          great blessing I had been to him and to his curate, and sa3'ing that he had thought it
          right to make a public acknowledg- ment of it on Sunday, stating that it was through a
          wcm.an's ministry in the pulpit he was gi'eatly blessed.</p>
        <p>From Newport we went to Bristol and were the guests of two lovely Friends, Robert and
          Catherine Charlton, persons of great benevolence and prominent in the Soci- ety of
          Friends. We found some of the young Friends engaged in a large Mission work, with much
          opposition among some Friends of their Meeting. Having been engaged in work of the same
          character we felt it right to mingle with and help them, although advised by some not to
          do so.</p>
        <p>Eventually it proved to be the right course, and did much good by awakening an interest
          amongst many for the young people. We afterwards received an ear- nest invitation from
          many Friends to return and hold a series of INIeetings in their Mission work.</p>
        <p>After a few days spent in Bristol, visiting the pris- ons, houses of bad repute, jails,
          etc., and objects of historic interest, we went to London where we found much the same
          state of things, many Friends much trou- bled, sincerely so, over the large missionary
          work going on in the city, as it was out of the regular course of the Society, and many
          found it hard to be reconciled to the innovations ; amongst these we had some
          influence.</p>
        <p>We had received while in Bristol an invitation to a reception given by William Fowler and
          his newly mar- ried wife, to the Christian workers, at their country home.</p>
        <p>The company arranged to go in an omnibus. It was dark when they called for us. We were
          entire strangers to all, having been introduced to but few. It was a novel experience,
          being crowded in the vehicle and dark, we had no knowledge of whom we were with.</p>
        <p>The company cared for us the best that was possi- ble. There sat by my side a young woman
          who entered into conversation with me upon her own personal expe- rience of a spiritual
          character. I did not know at all who she was. Twenty years afterwards we were in London
          attending a Meeting of the "Home Mission Association of Christian Workers" when my husband
          in his remarks alluded to that evening. His remarks were published in "The London Friend,"
          a copy of which reached Friends' Mission in Chung-Kung, China. A few months afterwards I
          received a letter from Mary J. Davidson stating that she had longed to write to me because
          of the great blessing I once was to her; that she was the young woman who sat by my side
          that evening in the omnibus, and my conversation had changed the whole line of her life,
          and caused her to go to that part of China as a Missionary, and told of the sood she was
          doincr. She said I was to receive a part of the reward, and explained that she had not
          known where I was nor how to reach me until she saw the notice of the Mission meeting, and
          our presence in London. It has made me very grateful to know the influence I unconsciously
          exerted that night was pro- ductive of such results. We have corresponded occa- sionally
          since, she being still engaged in the same Mis- sion which is most successful in its
          results.</p>
        <p>We found a very open door amongst Friends in England and received much kindness in many
          of their homes, and met with many opportunities for preaching the Gospel. We were
          surprised to find the prison doors closed to any service by their own people. Through
          William Tallack, Sir Walter Crofton became interested in our Mission and with his
          influence and the oflicial documents given to us by our own Government with the noble seal
          upon it, we had access to all of the pris- ons, and made a pretty thorough investigation
          of the system, but saw but little to commend. The discipline was very severe. The Sir
          Walter Crofton system had much to commend it, nine months of solitary confine- ment. If
          the conduct of the prisoners was good they were transferred to the congregated System, and
          by merit were finally transferred to the open System where they were given much trust and
          liberty and from this they were set free.</p>
        <p>We extended our visit to much of the Continent, then travelled by way of Alexandria,
          Cairo and the Isthmus of Suez to Port Said, and there sailed for Joppa where we arrived
          after a stormy night early in the morning of March 3, 1872. We anchored and were
          transferred to small rowboats by jumping off the deck into the arms of the boatman, a good
          strong man, and were conveyed as far as they could safely take us, and then were carried
          on their backs pick-a-pack to the landing. Here we found a moderately comfortable hotel,
          and after exploring the town pretty thoroughly, we started w^th a party of seven, under
          the care of our dragoman, a faithful man, on our journey on horseback, provided with
          tents, interpreter, cook, waiter and luggage. The journey was thrilling with the memories
          so sacred of the ages that had passed. We were six weeks in the Holy Land, rode six
          hundred and ninety-three miles on horse- back, passed through Ramah, Jabez, Gilead, to
          Jeini- salem, Hebron, Bethlehem, Bethany, to the Dead Sea and the River Jordan, to
          Jericho, Samaria and all the sites of the old cities. Bethel, Nazareth, Mt. Carmel, Haifa,
          Tyre, and over the mountains to the head of the Jordan. Then we passed over Mt. Hermon,
          striking the rivers of Abana and Pharphar and on down their valleys, through a rich,
          fertile country to Damascus. Here we spent several days, and then on to Baalbeck, the
          wonderful ruins, then over the Mountains of Leba- non to Beirut. From Beirut by boat we
          passed Rhodes, Smyrna, Cypinis and Ephesus, along the Paul- ine route through the Sea of
          Marmora to Constanti- nople, stopping at each place. After spending a few days and doing
          much sightseeing, we sailed down the Bosphorus and the Black Sea to Varna, where we took a
          train to Rusrstuck, then by boat up the Danube, a very beautiful river, through the Iron
          Gates amid beau- tiful scenerv, throucrh Orsovia, the boundarv line be- tween Hungary and
          Roumania, then to Bazius. We took breakfast at Pesth, the capital of Hungary, and went by
          rail through a beautiful agricultural country to Vienna, a beautiful city. After seeing
          this city and visiting some of the leading Government prisons, we left for Berlin,
          inspected the leading prison systems there, and went via Dresden to Hamburg. We had parted
          from the young lady companions who were with us much of our journey, and two young men,
          who left us for Paris. After risiting the refomiatories, prisons, etc., at Hamburg, we
          went to Frankfurt and from there to Stuttgart where we left our dear son Francis, who
          remained to pursue his education. From Stuttgart we went by ShafFhausen, a place of
          beautiful scenery, then passed through Zurich, Lucerne, and other parts of Switzerland,
          stopping at a number of interesting places. We took supper at a town in Belgium and
          visited Lou- vaine. one of the most interesting prisons we had visited.</p>
        <p>While travelling we visited and inspected some of the prisons in Italy and Austria and
          saw nothing to com- mend, but in Belgium at Louvaine, we witnessed a sys- tem which
          apparently had many valuable features. They had "The Separate System." Each prisoner had a
          separate cell and a small ground for exercise. None but the officers who receive them ever
          see their faces. They are given a mask which conceals the face, and no officer may enter
          their cell without giving notice of his approach, when the mask is pulled down. They each
          receive five visits a day by persons who are ap- pointed for that purpose, whose duty it
          is to converse with them. They have no communication from any one else. They may enter
          under an assumed name. The purpose is that no one may be able to recognize them when they
          are liberated from prison, and thus they be hindered from starting life afresh. They may
          gain much abatement on their sentence by good con- duct. The system had more points of
          excellence than any we saw.</p>
        <p>Our visit to the different prisons was profitable in so much that we saw some points
          which we were able afterward to see adopted in some of the prisons in our own country.</p>
        <p>After Louvaine we went to Amsterdam where we made a halt for a few days. We reached
          London very tired. We spent about two months in England attend- ing the Yearly Meeting,
          visiting some of the large meetings, prisons, etc. We reached home in the early part of
          July [1872], thankful for the privileges which had been given us and that our loved ones
          were all pre- served to us.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Coffin's paper, "The Women of the Orient," beginning on page 247 of this book, gives
          additional and interesting information of her observations.</p>

        <p>The inherent power of a mother's love kept open the eyes of iNIrs. Coffin upon her sons
          in whom she ever exercised a generous faith. She took much pride and pleasure in the
          practical energy and bright intelligence of her children, who in turn as they reached the
          years of man- hood, were uniformly subordinate to her wishes and gave her their hearty,
          devoted, considerate attentions, which yielded her unqualified satis- faction.</p>
        <p>Her sentiments of affectionate attachment perhaps moved her heart to wTite with excep-
          tional freedom of the inner relations of the family.</p>
        <p>As this work is printed for private circulation only, the reader, as he turns its pages,
          will be indulgent and easily forgive her — for she was their mother.</p>
        <p>Our little family grew more and more absorbing in interest. The children were active,
          bright and talented and required much careful training. Ours was a lovely family. There
          were many persons whose influence over our children was most helpful. When Elijah, our
          oldest son, was about twenty years of age, we sent him to Haverford College near
          Philadelphia, a Friends' Col- lege, where he remained several years, very creditably, but
          broke down in health before he was graduated, and returned home.</p>
        <p>Charles Henry's health failed while attending Friends' School at Richmond, Indiana,
          taught by Hiram Had- ley. This son was bright, learned with great ease, and we had no
          thought of the pressure. His teacher was very proud of his advancement, and ambitiously,
          but kindly, pushed him too far. He was about eleven years old when he became paralyzed in
          his lower limbs and lost the use of them. We were greatly troubled and sought advice from
          every quarter. Nothing could arouse him and we decided to take him to New York for treat-
          ment. We carried him by railway train at night to Niagara Falls. After several efforts
          which proved of no avail we employed a strong negro to carry him under the Falls. This
          aroused him up to life and in- terest. We took him by night to Albany and then down the
          Hudson River by boat. We failed to find a phj^si- cian in New York who gave us hope, and
          then we went to Philadelphia to Dr. Theophilus Beasley, a Friend physician, he and his
          lovely wife being very dear friends of ours. We were the guests of our dear friends, Jolui
          and Mary Whitall and their married children, Robert Pearsall and Hannah Whitall Smith, Dr.
          James Carey Thomas, and their families.</p>
        <p>After exhausting the medical aid at Philadelphia, we spent several weeks most
          delightfully with these friends at Atlantic City, staying with them and our friend, Ehza
          P. Gumey. All of them were exceedingly kind. We fortunately heard of the Swedish Movement
          cure and returned to New York City, and after consul- tation with Dr. Charles Fayette
          Taylor, one of the leading physicians in that school, who gave us hope, we decided to try
          the treatment and most successful it was. We were there many months; neither of us could
          be spared from our son continuously ; we therefore took turns in giving him attention and
          finally rejoiced in his full restoration. Dr. Charles Fayette Taylor was an exceedingly
          interesting man and to him we have always felt most grateful. During those months we met
          with many interesting persons and formed some delightful attachments.</p>
        <p>Francis Albion was in school at Earlham and fin- ished his education at Stuttgart,
          Gemiany, where he stayed some time to perfect himself in the language. He was taught by
          Mrs. Mulberger, and returned to us a good scholar in French and German, both of which he
          spoke fluently.</p>
        <p>William Edward was sent to Friends' Boarding School at Providence, where he was
          successfully passing through the course of study, when he was taken 111 with typhoid
          fever. After the severe attack, as soon as he was able he was taken home. For months he
          was a sufferer; he was not able to read. The physicians insisted that his mind should be
          kept actively en- gaged with something bright and amusing, and pre- scribed Artemus Ward's
          Works. I read them all to him and many a laugh we had. As he grew stronger we took Mark
          Twain and anything else that would keep his mind interested and active without effort. We
          read "Livingstone's Africa," and Stanley's "How I Found Livingstone," thus leading him on
          to stronger mental food. After some time he recovered, and entered the bank as messenger.
          None of the sons were able to re- turn to school again, and we were obliged to give up our
          chenshed idea of a thorough college education as had been our purpose.</p>
        <p>The four sons, all so near together, required much care, but they were a great delight
          and have always been a great comfort to us.</p>
        <p>Our children were taught their dependence upon God and to pray as soon as they could lisp
          the name Mother.</p>
        <p>Mary Amelia was born August 3, 1858. She was a religious child; she talked to her dolls
          of Jesus. On one occasion her brother, William Edward, of whom she was very fond, had done
          something for which I sent him to my room. She was greatly distressed and begged to go and
          see if he would be a good boy. To this I consented and soon I heard her asking" Jesus to
          make him a good boy. As the door was ajar I peeped in, and they were kneeling with arms
          around each other praying. They came out smiling holding each other's hands. She said, "
          Now, mamma, he is sorry. Jesus make him good, Jesus ' gib him,' <note n="16">
            <p>1 " Forgive him."</p></note> mamma, please ' gib. '</p>
        <p>Though so very young she seemed to grasp the idea of God as her Father, of her
          accountability to him, and of a Saviour's love. She would listen with rapture to that
          "sweet story of old, when Jesus was here among men," when He took little children in His
          arms and blessed them, and would repeat wth accuracy, "Suffer little children to come unto
          me, and forbid them not, for of such is the Kingdom of Heaven." Before I had thought her
          old enough to be taught to pray on seeing her little brother kneeling in prayer, she asked
          to join him, and ever after it was her practice before getting into her bed, in childlike
          simplicity to offer her little prayer.</p>
        <p>Her mind appeared to love to dwell on Heaven. As she went to bed the evening before her
          death, appar- ently perfectly well, she prayed to God to make her a good girl and take her
          to live with Jesus "right soon." She was seized with a convulsion the next day and her
          prayer was answered — she was taken home. It was a great trial. Many of our Friends came
          to mingle their tears with ours. Our prayers were heard and grace was given to say, "Thy
          will be done." She died May IT, 1862.</p>
        <p>Our memories of this engaging child, Marv Amelia, will never entirely fail of wandering
          back with sweet recollections of her short earth- life. She was an unusually precocious
          child, original in her ways, full of natural affection, kindly tempered, plump and
          attractive in her fair healthful beauty. For her there seemed every hopeful promise of a
          bright and useful womanhood. We recall the deep shadow that memorable Sabbath she was
          snatched away with an illness lasting but a few brief hours.</p>
        <p>"And he asked, who gathered this flower?</p>
        <p>And the gardener answered, The Master!</p>
        <p>And his fellow-servant held his peace." <note n="17">From a tombstone in Burdock
            Churchyard, England</note></p>
        <p>On April 25, 1865, our joys as well as our cares were inoteased by the birth of our sixth
          child, Percival Brooks. He was much younger than his brothers. He was a wee little babe. I
          had been very ill for months and at his birth the physicians thought he could not live and
          laid him aside to care for me. My aunt, Eliz- abeth Johnson, who was the mother of eleven
          children — ■ came in and taking him up, said, "I will bring him through." She carried him
          upstairs and with a knowl- edge of what was needful, she did bring him through and always
          said he was her boy.</p>
        <p>Anna Galvin, who had previously lived with us as a maid, hearing that my nurse had gone,
          came to my assistance. She had left me to keep house for her brother, but seeing my feeble
          health and that the babe was so delicate, she returned and cared for us most faithfully.
          She had the entire care of the baby, as I was several months recovering my health. She was
          devotedly attached to the child, and he became a vigor- ous, fat, little "roly-poly." Her
          brother finally closed his house and released her to remain with me, and she has lived
          with us ever since (1909). I assured her while I had a home it would be hers as she chose,
          and so she has remained with us forty-five years, and proved a most noble,
          self-sacrificing, conscientious, true helper. I want to leave a testimony of our love for
          her, for her worth and devotion to us and to our family. She has been with us throuo-h
          many sorrows, throuo-h sick- ness and death, through losses and ci'osses, always true,
          sympathetic, loving and tender. When circumstances arose which made a chancre of residence
          necessary and we decided to move to Chicago, I knew it would be sepa- rating^ her from her
          own family livincn at Richmond. Largely, owing to the expense, I told her she was free to
          go where she liked: she replied, "I want to stay with you, I will go with you anywhere, to
          the end of the earth." I tiTist, should she outlive us, that our dear children "^tH see
          that she is well cared for.</p>
        <p>"With Percival Brooks, I adopted a different course of training. I had tried to
          faithfully train our chil- dren, as I thoucrht in accord with the teachino;s of the Bible,
          but I became convinced that whipping as a pun- ishment was not the best way to develop a
          child, and that the tendency was to harden both the parents and the child, that" He that
          spareth the rod, spoiled the child," did not mean the sparing of whipping, but to enforce
          the necessity of discipline, keeping the child under paternal government and control as
          well as teach- ing the child the habit of obedience to parents and those who must control.
          Also the habit of self-restraint, controlling the temper, appetite and pas- sion, the
          proper use of all the faculties, and the re- sistance of abuse of any kind, how to develop
          all that is noble and true, and to keep the child well in hand. I came to believe that the
          development could be more successfully cultivated under the sunshine of love, than the
          cloud of fear. To this youngest child we gave a wealth of love, he was cradled in love and
          developed in love. I never punished him, but took the time from everything else when he
          needed discipline to patiently show the cause and the result, to teach him how to overcome
          it, to implant the principle, and help him apply it. The result was most satisfactory and
          the corroding and anxious care lessened. He was never sent to school, but was taught at
          home by private in- structors. I taught him, as I had all of the others, the primaries,
          spelling, reading, writing, arithmetic and geography. When we went abroad in the Autumn of
          1871 for nine months, we left him at Brooklyn, N. Y., with his aunt, Caroline E. Ladd, who
          cared for him most tenderly and lovingly. On our return, taking up the work of teaching
          him, it was discovered that his eyes were badly affected and troubled with unequal vision.
          The eyes had been strained, thereby necessitat- ing eyeglasses, and total cessation from
          their use in reading or study. We secured Mary Frankland, sister of Benjamin Frankland, as
          governess, who taught him for the most part orally for several years until his eyes became
          strong enough for moderate use. She was most faithful and laid a good foundation for his
          future. My cousin, Amy E. Johnson, who was an ex- cellent teacher, but engaged in a larger
          field, taught him for several months until we could get one who was quahfied in every way.
          We were most favored in the acquisition of Mrs. Daniel Dennis, a lovely, painstaking
          teacher with remarkable ability for teaching, cultured mind and conscientious in her work.
          She carefully taught him how to think, to reason, and to use his mind and develop its
          powers.</p>
        <p>Dr. Dougan Clark was most successful as his tutor in his college course. The course we
          had taken in our son's education was entirely at variance with Dr. Clark's conception of
          the proper way of educating a boy. He was a college professor, and thought there was no
          other method. He watched his pupil's development with great interest and in the end was
          forced to acknowledge that he had never had a so enthusiastic, painstaking student, or a
          mind better trained.</p>
        <p>We always read with our children of evenings in a systematic way which I regard as having
          been very beneficial to us all, keeping us in touch with their studies and in line of
          thous:ht tos"ether.</p>
        <p>The care and training of our children was an inter- esting privilege, a period I look
          back to with much pleasure. They early accepted Christ as a Saviour. They gave us
          reverence and love, and were most de- voted and self-sacrificing. Nothing was too good nor
          great to do for us. They were full of life and energy, enthusiastic and aspiring. It was
          most interesting to watch their progress, and rightly to govern them was a great
          responsibility.</p>
        <p>I am greatly comforted in the knowledge that they have developed into men of ability,
          courageous, consci- entious Christian men. They have passed through man}" severe trials
          and are still meeting them with steadfastness of faith and courage. They have gone
          steadily on, are devoted to each other, bearing one another's burdens and trials and
          difficulties which they have unitedly met and overcome, which has bound them closely
          together. They have been and are our com- panions and counsellors. Praise be the Lord who
          has given us such blessings.</p>
        <p>In the choice of their wives they have brought to us five loving daughters who were taken
          to our hearts and given a parent's love, and to us a daughter's love beauti- fully
          returned. I thought as my sons grew to man- hood that I could never endure to be
          transplanted by another in their affections. It was a weak thought, one shared by many
          mothers. It vanished never to re- turn.</p>
        <p>It was a great pleasure when in 1869, Elijah chose Sarah Elma Fletcher for his wife ; she
          was a young woman of whom I was very fond, and with whom I was closely associated. It was
          very sweet to take her into our hearts and home as a daughter — I realized she could do
          more for him than I could do. During these intervening years the close fellowship, the
          intimate re- lations have grown with a deeper love. She has been a most devoted, loving
          daughter. Their home was near us and continued for a few years until the time came that
          our paths must separate on their removal else- where.</p>
        <p>The marriage of Charles Henry, our second son, to Flora Howells, daughter of Dr. Joseph
          Howells, was a most welcome choice to us. She came with a warm, loving heart and was
          received as a daughter, and in the years that have passed she never failed in her devotion
          and love.</p>
        <p>It was but a few years later that Francis Albion brought to our hearts and home Flora
          Roberts, daugh- ter of John and Mary Roberts, of Indianapolis, Indi- ana. She was a young
          woman well chosen, just fitted for him and for us, one whom we soon learned to love with
          full hearts. She was always ready to make any sacrifice or do anything for us, and most
          nobly has stood by her husband through many fiery trials. They were married in the
          Episcopal Church in Richmond, Indiana, at five o'clock in the afternoon, September 15,
          1875. On the same afternoon at six o'clock, William Edward, our fourth son, was manned to
          Lydia Rob- erts, sister of Flora's, in the Eighth Street Meeting of Friends in Richmond,
          each couple attending the other at the marriage ceremonies. Thus we had " twin daughters,"
          as a Friend observed in her congratula- tions. She remarked that she had heard me say, "I
          had always wanted twin daughters, and she thought our Heavenly Father had been very good
          to me, to give me a pair already brought up." We felt these to be a great blessing to us.
          Our fourth daughter found warm hearts and a special niche to fill, for which she was just
          fitted. She was loving, kind and thought- ful. Her love toward us has been most striking,
          never growing cold.</p>
        <p>In the year 1887 our son Percival Brooks increased our joy by his marriage to Lucy
          Vincent Baxter, daughter of William and Mary Baxter, of Richmond, Indiana, a 3'Oung woman
          of bright promise, of similar training and habit of thought as our son. They had been
          intimate friends from childhood. She was most cordially received and embraced in the
          family circle, and through years of sorrow and joy, she has entwined herself more and more
          into our affection. We are united as one family, living together in the same home, and
          have enjoyed the sweet ministrations and evidences of her love; thus our lives have been
          so blessed that our hearts are full of praise.</p>
        <p>In 1870, Elijah's son Charles Francis was bom, a most welcome child; all of us hailed his
          coming with great delight. He was but a few years younger than Percival Brooks, and they
          were close companions. He seemed like one of our own. As they lived next door we saw much
          of him and became strongly attached to him. He has grown to be a young man of fine appear-
          ance and correct life and a good business man. To his delight in 1878, his sister,
          Elizabeth Coffin, was sent to the household to cheer and shine as a sunbeam; a great
          pleasure she has been to us.</p>
        <p>To Charles Henry and Flora nine children have been given. Their eldest, Julius Howells,
          born 1875, remained with them eighteen years. He was an earnest Christian, very
          conscientious and of strong moral prin- ciple. Nothing could swerve him from what he con-
          sidered his duty and to do right. He was very deli- cate in health and loved to come and
          stay with us because our home was quiet. He called our home his "paradise," for with so
          many little ones, the noise in his own home sometimes disturbed him. He was taken from us
          to his heavenly home in 1893. His brother, Murray Howells, who was born in 1880, died
          1881, and his sister Miriam, born 1892, died . Vir- ginia died in infancy, 1890. They are
          all beckoning us on to meet them in the eternal home.</p>
        <p>Rhoda, — Charles Henry and Flora's eldest daughter, — and the first granddaughter in the
          family circle, was born June 11, 187T. We were especially delighted to welcome her, as the
          children thus far of the second generation, had all been sons. Ruth came next, boni 18T8,
          Charles Howells, 1882, then Flora, born 1885, a sweet, lovely girl, and Francis Joseph
          Howells, bom 1889, who remained to cheer and brighten the home life, all loving children
          full of promise.</p>
        <p>Ruth Howells, their second daughter, married Kreigh Collins, the son of Isaac Collins, of
          Chicago. Their little daughter, named Rhoda Coffin Collins, bom May 15, 1899, is a sweet
          little girl. A second daughter, called Ruth Miriam, was bom November 28, 1906. These are
          lovely children and a great pleasure to us.</p>
        <p>The following was weitten by Mrs. Coffin five years later than the last record:</p>

        <p>Since writing the above our dear daughter, Flora Howells Coffin, the wife of Charles
          Henry, and the mother of the above family, has been gathered home to eternal peace and
          joy, a great loss to our family, and to her own family irreparable. Twenty-nine years she
          was permitted to be with us and the tendrils of her heart sank deep into ours. She was a
          noble woman, beloved by many, and to us was a loving daughter. Her place leaves a great
          blank. After months of intense suffering, which she bravely met, she was taken home to be
          " forever with the Lord."</p>
        <p>Mrs. Flora Howells Coffin was a woman wor- thy in deed to be remembered. She was born in
          Urbana, Ohio, February 2d, 1852, and mar- ried Charles Henry Coffin, December 10th, 1873.
          She died at their winter home, Pass Christian, Mississippi, April 13th, 1902, and was
          interred two days later at Oakwood Cemetery, Chicago.</p>
        <p>As she grew to womanhood she grasped the beautiful and spiritual principles and doctrines
          of the Church of Swedenborg, and as long as she lived, she entertained high ethical views
          of the relation we bear in this life to the spiritual realm. This belief influenced to a
          marked de- gree her daily hving and led her to lofty ideals and attainment of domestic
          affection, and the dignity of life in the home. Her heart gave vitality to her intellect.
          The rich finer essence of her soul was a perennial picture which crossed the vision of
          those about her and still shines im- mortal from the realm above. She lived and rested in
          confident and certain assurance of happiness in the life to come. Some years be- fore she
          "passed onward" she, together with her husband and their children, were confirmed in the
          Protestant Episcopal Church.</p>
        <p>Francis Albion and his dear wife have been denied children.</p>
        <p>William Edward and Lydia have three noble sons, who are now young married men. Their
          eldest Tris- tram Roberts, passed through a college course at Co- lumbia University, and
          the other two, John Roberts, and Ralston Roberts, through Yale University. The three sons
          are now in New York City in the bond busi- ness with their father — fine, noble fellows, a
          great com- fort to us all.</p>
        <p>Tristram Roberts Coffin mamed Marion Richards on October 22, 190-i. They have two
          children : Lydia Constance, bom March 27, 190T, and Tristram Rich- ards, born October 15,
          1908.</p>
        <p>John Roberts Coffin maiTied Mary Belle Hudson, April 27, 1905. Their children are:
          Harriet Hudson, bom December 2, 1906, and Ralston Hudson, bom November 16, 1908.</p>
        <p>Since Mrs. Coffin wrote the above, the youngest son of William Edward and Lydia Roberts
          Coffin, Ralston Roberts, who was born in Indianapolis, Indiana at 10:40 P. M., December
          31st, 1883, entered into eternal rest, September 5th, 1909.</p>
        <p>He was but a young boy when his parents removed to New York City. He received his
          preparatory education at the Cutler School in New York, and at St. Paul's School, Concord,
          New Hampshire, at both of which he was a most satisfactory pupil. He entered Columbia Uni-
          versity in his sixteenth year. After a course of study there he entered Yale University
          and was g-raduated from the Sheffield Scientific School, Class 1903. During his College
          years he dis- tinguished himself as a typical athlete. At Co- lumbia University he was one
          of the foot-ball team of 1899 which defeated Yale, and was the youngest man who ever rowed
          in a varsity crew at Poughkeepsie, N. Y., when in a Columbia boat. At Yale he played on
          the varsity foot- ball team for two years and was a member of the varsity crews of 1902
          and 1903, both of vdiich won the Yale-Harvard race. He was a member of the Yale "Book and
          Snake Society." He was baptized when a child at St. Thomas Episcopal Church, New York, and
          confirmed of his own desire while at St. Paul's School.</p>

        <p>Possessed by nature of a vigorous physique and a bright intellect, courageous, gentle and
          sympathetic in temjDerament, full of quiet energy, broad-shouldered, and with a wholesome
          countenance, his personal presence was observed wherever he was.</p>
        <p>When he completed his college course he en- tered the bond house of Coffin k Company, New
          York City and became a junior partner. His ability as well as his fidehty in business
          rela- tions, were recognized in business circles. He was congenial in his work and
          companionship with his business associates, and his untimely death was sincerely mourned
          by them.</p>
        <p>Ralston's natural impulses and inclinations were of the student type. Though popular in
          society, he was of a home-loving spirit, his pref- erence being to spend his evenings at
          home ^^ith his books and the family, to whom he was de- votedly attached.</p>
        <p>He enjoyed the best of health until the last few weeks of his life, when an operation on
          his liver became necessary, from the effects of which he died.</p>
        <p>His mortal remains were laid to rest on an elevated knoll commanding a charming jDrospect
          in beautiful Woodlawn on the afternoon of Sep- tember 7th, 1909, amid a wealth of flowers
          and offerings from hosts of friends, just as the firma- ment of heaven was made gloriously
          brilliant by the light and rich coloring of the setting Sun, whose rays in splendor cast
          their long streams of golden light across the little strip of earth he now occupies. This
          rich display and glory of scenic grandeur seemed a divine benediction to his earthly
          career, and with us the memory of the impressive scene will not soon fade. We mourn- fully
          lingered about the sacred spot sorely reluc- tant to leave him "sleeping" — though he had
          passed</p>
        <p>"Beyond the smiling and the weeping."</p>
        <p>Our son, Percival Brooks and his wife, Lucy Vin- cent Baxter Coffin, have no children,
          but are devoted to us. We are a happy family.</p>
        <p>They have brought their Certificate of Membership to Chicago Friends' Meeting, which
          gives us much sat- isfaction. I love to look at them as we worship together in the
          meeting.</p>
        <p>Who would not be happy with such children and grandchildren? They are an unspeakable
          blessing, and our prayers for them are that they may be used in our Father's hands for
          great good to others.</p>
        <p>At a later period — without date — Mrs. Cof- fin writes a summary of the lives of some
          mem- bers of her father's family.</p>
        <p>Before closing this Family History, I would bear a loving testimony to the worth of my
          eldest brother, Brooks Johnson, who died April 2, 1900. He was a man of great strength, an
          original thinker, far ahead of his generation in many ways, full of anecdotes and humor.
          He had a sympathetic heart for those in dis- tress, particularly for those who had in
          their latter days been deprived of the luxuries of life. He lived a long life of
          usefulness, and after months of decline caused by paralysis, died in full faith in his
          Redeemer. Between him and myself there vras a strong bond of union and confidence : no one
          could use the freedom with him that I could use : we loved each other devotedly.</p>
        <p>The last time that I visited him previous to his death, we had an "experience meeting."
          To listen to his reli- gious ideas was a great privilege which no one else had enjoyed. He
          had great faith in true Christianity, but scorned sham. He said to me, "I have never felt
          that it was right to be parading my experience before others, but to you I will speak of
          my confidence. God is my Father — I love Him — Christ is my Saviour, He is my only hope.
          It is not important to me what the preacher says, it is what he knozi'S and what " these
          hands have handled.*' I would rather hear some old Auntie tell of what she has learned and
          enjoyed of personal contact with Christ — I would rather hear some dear old lady like Mary
          Elliott, full of love and ten- derness, with a warm heart, tell of what she knows and
          feels than any popular orator with all his scholastic power." His testimony was a great
          comfort to me. I felt his death keenly.</p>
        <p>In 1853 my brother was married the second time, to Mary P. Stroud, daughter of Charles
          and Susan Stroud, a woman not far from his own age. She was a woman of a good deal of
          ability — a faithful wife.</p>
        <p>Of this marriage there were bom two children, a daughter whose birth took place May 6,
          1861, called Georgiana Stroud, a child of winning ways and Ra- phael-like beauty, far
          above the usual type. But her stay was brief. She died May 10, 1864. <note n="18"> Walter
            S. Mendenhall died at his home in Cincinnati, Ohio, June, 1910.— The Editor.</note></p>
        <p>Charles Stroud, the second child, was bom January 23, 1863. He was a lovely boy. Between
          the mother and this son there was an unusually strong attachment. He married Martha
          Sterrett, October 16, 1884, in Glendale, near Cincinnati, Ohio, a bright, warm-hearted
          young woman. His mother, after my brother's death, lived with him and died at his home in
          Cincinnati, Ohio, May 26, 1893.</p>
        <p>John Edward Johnson, Brooks Johnson's eldest son, died in Cincinnati, Ohio, April 18,
          1868, aged twenty- four years.</p>
        <p>Again Mrs. Coffin writes:</p>
        <p>Sister Phoebe — my eldest sister, made her home with us after sister Rachel's death. She
          was a great help v/ith our children, one in whom I could always trust. From childhood she
          was a partial invalid and a great sufferer. She died January 13, 1863.</p>
        <p>After he left Friends' Boarding School, brother Eli went into a dry-goods store with
          Benjamin Stratton. In course of time he married Charles' sister, Mary Cof- fin, and
          removed to Cincinnati, Ohio, and went into business partnership with his brother, Brooks
          Johnson. He died February 25, 1901.</p>
        <p>In 1850 sister Rachel, my youngest sister, a beautiful girl, and dear to me, came to make
          her home with us. She was educated at Friends' Boarding School (now Earlham College) and
          at another Friends' Boarding School at Proyidence, R. I. She aftei'wards became a teacher
          in the first-mentioned school. She was very popular with her associates. She married
          Stephen C. Mendenhall, and they liyed near us at Richmond, Indi- ana, which gave me great
          pleasure. Her first children were twins, Emma Rachel and Walter Stephen, born in 1855.^
          Afterwards there were born to them Olivia ; Her- bert, who died in infancy, and Rhoda. Our
          children grew up together very much as one family.</p>
        <p>There were bom seven in the family of my parents, and all have passed over, — beyond —
          but myself. All died in the triumphs of living faith, having fought a good fight and kept
          the faith. I only am left; some- times there comes to me a feeling of great loneliness, as
          I see my husband enjoying his brother and sisters, and I have none, no uncle or aunt, only
          three nephews and four nieces.</p>

        <p>"Until the day break and the shadows flee away." — Canticles, 1, 17.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Coffin was now near the completion of her earthly course. The last few years found
          her living quietly in her home, in contentment and physical repose. The disabilities of
          age crept slowly upon her. She abandoned her active and beneficent labors only when the
          feebleness of advancing years compelled her.</p>
        <p>The following narrative of her last days and decease we record in the words of her
          husband:</p>
        <p>For the last several months my beloved wife was very frail, but her mind was bright and
          clear, and she was able to enjoy a great many of the passing events of life, and to ride
          out every day and attend the Morning Meeting on First days. This she greatly enjoyed,
          although unable to take much active part in the public exercise of her gift as a minister.
          The kindly greeting of her friends gave her much pleasure; she frequently offered vocal
          pra^^er and sometimes made a few re- marks. She was very much looked up to by the mem-
          bers of the Meeting, and was consulted on many matters which concerned them. She had
          remarkably good judgment and a strong mind, and was able to give helpful advice to those
          who were in trouble or sorrow of any kind.</p>
        <p>She attended Meeting for the last time on First day, ninth month, 5th, 1909, and offered
          vocal prayer; she also asked for the hymn "Nearer, My God, to Thee," to be sung.</p>
        <p>On the same day we received a telegram announcing the death of a beloved grandson in New
          York. Per- cival and myself immediately took the Twentieth Cen- tury Express on the Lake
          Shore Railroad and went directly to that city arriving there on the morning of the next
          day. We found the household of my son William Edward in great trouble and sorrow. Ralston
          was a very remarkable young man and his loss was most deeply felt by us all. After
          spending two days in New York and attending the funeral, we returned home by the same
          route.</p>
        <p>On First day, ninth month, twelfth, my wife was at- tacked by diarrhea and in her frail
          physical condition, her strength was soon so greatly reduced that her physicians found it
          impossible for her to rally, although at one time she seemed much like recovering, but
          addi- tional complications arose, and she was exceedingly ill until she passed away.</p>
        <p>She was generally quite conscious, was perfectly aware of her condition and expressed her
          preference to be at rest with Christ. Her sons from New York strongly urged her to use her
          will power toward recov- ering. This she had done other times under similar circumstances,
          but this time she was unable to rally, and the disease continued to make progress until
          her recovery was past hope. She could not see company during her illness, and had not,
          when making effort to speak, strength of voice to be understood without great exertion on
          the part of the listener.</p>
        <p>She quietly and peacefully breathed her last on the twenty-eighth of ninth month,
          nineteen hundred and nine.</p>
        <p>Her five sons who had hastened to her bedside, and her nephew, Charles S. Johnson, from
          Cincinnati, ar- rived in time to be present when she breathed her last. There was a
          remarkable, peaceful, quiet and restful expression upon her countenance after death.
          During her exceeding weakness she did not suffer acute pain, but often spoke of her
          earnest desire for quiet and rest.</p>
        <p>It was a fitting close of a long and useful life. She was eighty-three years old on the
          first of second month, 1909. She had led a very active life, largely devoted to the good
          of others.</p>
        <p>The next day after her death her body was taken to Friends' Meeting House, Xo. 4411
          Indiana Avenue. There was a wealth of flowers which covered the cof- fin and pulpit. The
          house was well filled with rela- tives and friends, and the service, while simple, was
          exceedinglv beautiful. William Henry Matchett con- ducted the ser^'ice, and gave a most
          appropriate and beautiful discourse, concise, but touching and full of life. The service
          was opened by singing the hymn, "Rock of Ages," which was followed by Scripture reading
          and some remarks by Alfred Bastin, who closed</p>
        <p>his remarks by reading a beautiful poem. He was followed by Charlotte Vickers, who had
          been intimately associated with my wife in religious work, and who bore brief testimony to
          her valuable life, and closed her remarks by reading a poem by Longfellow. This was
          followed by the hymn, "Nearer, My God, to Thee." The services closed with the hymn, "Abide
          with Me," and an opportunity was offered for those present to look upon her face before
          the casket was closed. It had been decided that the burial should be at Richmond,
          Indiana.</p>
        <p>On the evening of the 29th, accompanied by my chil- dren, relatives and friends we
          entered a special car with our beloved dead and reached Richmond early the next morning.
          We were met at the railroad station at a very early hour by a number of our friends and
          relatives, among whom were Timothy Nicholson, Ben- jamin Johnson, and Samuel
          Dickinson.</p>
        <p>The casket was taken to the Friends' Meeting House on South Eighth Street, preparatory to
          holding a serv- ice in the afternoon.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, hundreds of persons called upon us at the hotel where we were stopping —
          personal friends and many others whom we had almost forgotten came to extend their
          sympathy and love to us. There were representatives from Muncie, Cambridge City, Indian-
          apolis, and Vernon, Indiana, several from Cincinnati, and from other towns within reach.
          Two of my nephews, Albert and William Henry Coffin, came pur- posely, one from eastern
          Illinois and the other from Henry County, Indiana.</p>

        <p>After receiving the sympathetic expression of several hundreds of our friends, a meeting
          was held at two o'clock on the afternoon of the 30th. The House, sup- posed to hold about
          five hundred, was completely filled with more people than could procure seats. The cas-
          ket was again covered with floral offerings, and the ros- trum was also exquisitely
          arranged with flowers. The service was simple and most appropriate. A sketch of her life
          was read by the pastor of the church. Edward Bellis, an old friend of ours, read a portion
          of Scrip- ture, made some beautiful remarks, and closed with a prayer. He was followed by
          Allen Jay, in a simple but appropriate discourse, in which he bore testimony to the life
          and work of my dear wife, and closed with a prayer.</p>
        <p>Many persons had gone to the church previous to the Meeting, to look on the placid face
          of my beloved one, and at the close of the service many others came for the same
          purpose.</p>
        <p>The burial was at Earlham Cemetery. My dear parents were buried there, and our only
          daughter Mary Amelia, who died more than forty years ago (1860) was also burled there. In
          the same lot in which she lay, the remains of my dear wife were interred. A large crowd of
          persons was present and after prayers by Allen Jay and Levi Pennington, and the reading of
          a poem by Mary Perry Bellis, the casket was low- ered into the tomb.</p>
        <p>It was a solemn occasion. There was something to me extremely stregthening to witness the
          devotion of our dear friends and the deep feeling which prevailed. Through it all I have
          to bear testimony to the supporting hand of my Heavenly Father. I realize that "God is my
          strength and my salvation, a very present help in time of need," and that "The Ever-
          lasting Arms" are underneath me.</p>
        <p>The memory of my dear one is most precious. After more than sixty-two years of happy
          married life, dur- ing which we were thoroughly united in all the duties and activities of
          life, I miss her companionship exceedingly, but I can only say from the depths of my heart
          "The Will of the Lord, be done."</p>

        <p>First Friends' Church of Chicago, Ill, Indiana Avenue and -i-ith Street</p>
        <p>Chicago, Nov. IT, 1909. To Charles F. Coffin and Family:</p>
        <p>The enclosed memorial of Rhoda M. Coffin has been prepared by direction of Chicago
          Monthly Meeting of Friends and spread upon its minutes with the instructions to the Clerk
          that a copy be forwarded to thee and thy family.</p>
        <p>On behalf of Chicago Monthly Meeting.</p>
        <p>Very truly,</p>
        <p>Chas. C. Hubbaud,</p>
        <p>Clerk.</p>
        <p>Testimony of Chicago Monthly Meeting of Rhoda M. Coffin, A Mister, deceased, Sept. •?Sth,
          1909, in the 54th year of her age.</p>
        <p>Rhoda M. Coffin was the daughter of John and Judith John- son, and was born in Green
          Co^mty, Ohio, Second Month, 1826. Her parents were active members of the Society of
          Friends, and she was carefully brought up in a religious atmosphere. Early in life she
          gave her heart to God and became a Christian, which event she always referred to vrith
          great satisfaction. "When she was about nine years of age her parents removed to "Warren
          County, Ohio, and settled on the banks of the Miami, opposite the town of
          "Waynesville.</p>
        <p>On the 20th day of 3d Month, 1847, she married Charles F. Coffin. This commenced a happy
          union, which continued for over sixty-two years. They lived in Richmond, Ind. for nearly
          forty years. During the early part of her married life, her health was very poor, but she
          possessed undaujated energy-, great force of character, and unusual mental ability, and
          overcame all the obstacles which stood in her way, living a life of great usefulness. For
          a long time she and her husband were active in a Bible School which was started during the
          Civil "War, when many wives of soldiers, with their children were living in the city.
          During the visitation of cholera in Richmond, she mingled with those who were stricken,
          without any hesitation or at all thinking of herself.</p>
        <p>She was active in Church Work, and became a Minister of the Gospel more than forty years
          ago. Since then she has traveled in the service of Christ through many lands. In the years
          1871-3 in company with her husband, she visited England and attended many of the Friends'
          Meetings there, and took part in the Mission work carried on by Friends and others. She
          then traveled through the continent of Europe, and spent six weeks in Palestine.</p>
        <p>She removed with her husband to Chicago in 1884, and in this city became actively engaged
          in the work that had occupied so much of her life in Indiana. She was specially interested
          in Women's and Girls' prison and reformatory work.</p>
        <p>Rhoda M. Coffin preserved until her last sickness, a very re- tentive memory, a keen
          sympathy and deep interest in passing events especially those belonging to the Society of
          Friends in America and England. It was to her a source of pleasure to attend meeting and
          take part in the same, either by reading of scripture, a personal testimony, a short vocal
          prayer or calling for a favorite hymn.</p>
        <p>Recognizing the necessity of earnest progressive thought and work in order that the
          church might fulfill its mission, she manifested a spirit of love towards those that felt
          called to this work. At the same time she was desirous that the work might progress along
          those Evangelical lines in which her faith was grounded and had been so fruitful in her
          work for the Master.</p>
        <p>She had been for several months in a very feeble state of health, but was able to be
          about the house, ride out daily, and to attend meetings on First Day Morning. Feeling that
          her work was almost accomplished she lived in the constant hope and confidence of the
          Everlasting Life purchased for her through the merits of Christ her Saviour.</p>
        <p>In the closing days of her illness as the end approached she longed "for rest," and we
          have the confidence that " the rest that remains for the people of God " was her portion,
          and the assurance that "blessed are the dead which die in the Lord, Yea, Saith the Spirit,
          that they may rest from their labors: and their works do follow them."</p>

      <div type="chapter">
        <p>During the Civil War between the North and South, beginning in the Spring of 1861,
          Richmond, Indiana not only increased in population, but poverty also in- creased. A
          house-to-house visitation was made which brought to light much poverty and many sorrowing
          hearts, and that many children were growing up with- out any religious teaching. We
          decided to make an effort to gather some of these into a Sunday school. In the early part
          of my married life I was given a class of Friends' children to teach who were not old
          enough to read. They were all children of Friends, and very lovely, and easily interested.
          I was very much at a loss as to what to do. I had never seen an infant class, but I set
          myself to work teaching orally. Ten of these s-irls were with me ten years, until they
          were young women, all earnest Christians, old enough and prepared to teach. When Fifth
          Street Meeting (now Eighth street) was established, the class was disbanded. Between us
          there had grown a strong bond of love. They all volunteered to help start the Mission
          School. It required the canvass of the town, which we accomplished, and procuring the use
          of an old public school building, we opened the Mission School with thirty children.</p>
        <p>With two pupils I opened my infant class. We had a goodly number of teachers and devoted
          workers. We soon learned that singing was essential. The adop- tion of this exercise
          caused grief to some honest Friends and, strange to say, gave us much trouble. Our school
          prospered and we were obliged to seek for larger quarters. We rented a vacant church
          build- ing, and removed to it until we could procure a suit- able lot and build. We built
          our new Meeting House on what is now Eighth street, the second story for a church, and the
          ground floor for our Christian work. The citizens contributed largely to the fitting up of
          the basement for our school. There was in time as many as eight hundred children enrolled
          at one time. Five hundred and twenty-three of these were in my class, aged from three to
          fifteen. I obtained a thorough knowledge of every scholar, and of their homes. I threw my
          whole strength and interest into it, and sought to bring them into a knowledge of Christ.
          I studied the children and chose the subject and lesson needed as I stood before them and
          taught. They were not told what would be the lesson for the next week — they knew there
          would be something new and of interest. They were always certain that there would be some
          surprise.</p>
        <p>I at one time offered to give a very pretty china doll to the girl who would bring ten
          scholars In three weeks, the time of our anniversary. It was very Important that they
          should have confidence in me, so I took much pains to have the doll prettily dressed. To
          my surprise eight girls brought in the requisite num- ber. I was out of pocket several
          dollars, but I had gained their confidence, and estabhshed an interest in the school. At
          the same time of the offer to the girls, I offered to the boys who would bring in ten, a
          nice little wacron. Several boys commenced with eacremess but gave up, all but one little
          boy about seven years old. He won the prize. He was a pretty, sweet, boy who but to see
          was to love. He worked faithfully and Willie Evans was the victor.</p>
        <p>I saw what was coming and prepared to teach the boys a lesson, so purchased a nice wagon
          in which the boy could ride himself, and when the prize was given, with one voice they
          exclaimed, "I did not know that it was going to be that kind of a wagon or I would have
          worked for it! I thought it was to be a little baby wagon. Say. Mrs. Coffin, won't you let
          us try again?" The lesson was the same, but the result was different. I declined their
          request. My great aim was to bring them to Christ and so teach as to build them up to the
          right standard of living, and I had the privilege of seeing: many of them chanc^ed bovs
          and crirls.</p>
        <p>I visited in their homes and received a cordial wel- come. My scholars were from the
          saloons, from wrecked homes, from the rich and the poor. " The rich and the poor meet
          together and the Lord is the maker of them all," was our motto. I visited in sick- ness
          and death. During a visitation of the cholera in Richmond, numbers of both parents and
          children died. The father and mother and two children of one of my families died, leaving
          three children, a little girl of seven, a boy four, and a girl two years old. Their only
          possession was a dime with a hole in it, and tied about the neck with a white cord. Their
          daughter of eight was afterward taken sick and died in the city. She sent her love to me
          and said she was going to Jesus, and would I have the hymn sung at her funeral "The Throne
          of God in Heaven." I was sent for early in the morning and found all of the family ill.
          The mother dying, begged me to tell her how to be saved. While I was leading her to Christ
          the physician came and ordered me out ; said it was the worst kind of in- fectious cholera
          and my life was too valuable to be wasted. I told him I would not go until I saw her ac-
          cept salvation, or was dead. He shook like a leaf. Lov- ingly, patiently, and prayerfully
          I pointed the way and rejoicingly she accepted Christ.</p>
        <p>The husband was intensely anxious for her salvation, but would not accept himself. The
          house was full of death. He was removed to another house, and a man was provided to nurse
          him. I stayed with him as much as possible through the day, till reason gave way and he
          died. Commending him to God I left him. For six weeks I was going from house to house,
          from death to death, for many of them had no one to care for them. The three little
          children I looked after a few weeks until I could find some one to care for them. I took
          them one day to our Yearly Meeting then in session, and made an appeal which met with a
          response. Jehu Jessup and wife, he a minister, took the baby and adopted it with their own
          eight children. Hiram Hough and wife accepted the other two, and lovingly cared for
          them.</p>
        <p>In connection with my class, I saw much of the inner life of the families, and was the
          confidant of many, and able to lift the burden and relieve many. Many men in their zeal or
          excitement forgetting their duties of fathers and husbands rushed to the war which was
          then racnncf: some were killed, others forgot their own and lavished what little they had
          on others. The mari- tal tie was stretched to its utmost, much bitterness and separation
          followed. It was my privilege to heal the breach and bring them together. I was very happy
          in after years to receive their thanks for what I had done. There were many orphan
          children whom we aided to get homes. A large part of the children were gathered into the
          Sunday school. After years of joy- ous service, when my class was large, I was about to
          leave the work but became suddenly impressed that this was my last opportunity to win
          those children to Christ. I made a direct appeal, told them that I was going away and
          never should see some of them again. I asked them how many of them were Christians.
          Several hands went up. I then asked how many of them wished to be Christians — that Jesus
          was here. — he had new hearts for all of them, that the least of them could have one, and
          that he said " Let the children come," " Ask and ye shall receive," that we must just let
          him take the naughty heart and give us a new one full of love. I told them to say what I
          said, and just think of what he was doing. I prayed just as I told them to do. One little
          girl of seven years unbuttoned her jacket and held it open and said, "Dear Jesus, come in,
          I'm ready." Forty, to all appearing, then and afterwards were saved. Taking this little
          girl upon my knee I said, "Nellie what did Jesus do for you?" Looking up sweetly she said,
          "Mrs. Coffin he did give me one, it 'taint a bit like the other one, it is full of love."
          That child was afterward tested to the utmost, and was saved.</p>
        <p>There has rarely been a more efficient and noble band of workers than were in that
          Mission, all laboring for the relief of the distressed and suffering and for the uplifting
          of the helpless — Joseph Dickinson, and wife and daughter, Samuel Francis Fletcher and
          family, our own sons and their families. Dr. William Waring and his wife Semira, Mary
          Smith, Lottie Smith, Hannah M. Johnson, W. B. Hadley and wife, Elwood Hadley and wife,
          Benjamin Johnson and wife, Martha Valen- tine, and many others.</p>
        <p>The Mothers' Meeting was established, at which the women were taught to cut, and sew, and
          mend gar- ments, assisted by a band of conscientious women, and a Children's Meeting where
          they also were taught to sew and read. My husband was superintendent of the School and
          conducted a Prayer Meeting on Friday evenings, and a Men's Meeting on Sunday evening where
          much good was accomplished.</p>
        <p>Many women were going from place to place, into many e^ols, which grasped them in the
          worst form. There was no place for them to stay at night, except in a low prison or
          lodging houses, very unfit for women to enter. My husband threw his whole soul into the
          various branches of work, and in all the various in- terests we went hand in hand. I
          praise the Lord that we were permitted to be united. After years of toil and laboring in
          sweet fellowship, the time came for other hands to do the work. Elijah, our son, took the
          place of his father and had a noble helper in his preci- ous wife.</p>

          and is still fulfilling the purpose of its existence.</p>

      <div type="chapter">
        <p>An account of the origin of "The Home for the Friendless" built in Richmond, Indiana, and
          of the connection of my dear husband and myself including some others who were real
          helpers in its incipient stage —</p>
        <p>In visiting amongst the scholars of our Mission School, and the poor, connected with our
          Mission work, a great need was developed of a Home where helpless women with children,
          friendless girls, strangers passing through our city, who for various causes must be cared
          for temporarily, diseased, deformed, and illegitimate children, the two latter not
          received in any Children's Home — a place where the friendless sick might be nursed, and
          erring girls might have a way to escape.</p>
        <p>My dear husband, who was president of the Y. M. C. A. which had just been organized,
          together with Stephen C. Mendenhall, William F. Spencer, Christo- pher Jackson, and some
          others became interested, and agreed to get the Y. M. C. A. to take up the work. They
          introduced the subject, and a committee was ap- pointed consisting of Rhoda M. Coffin,
          Mary Jackson, Rachael Mendenhall, and Sarah Iliff Davis, to confer with a committee of
          gentlemen and report to next meeting. The result was the appropriation of $150, pro- vided
          the ladies above mentioned could secure women memberships to the Y. M. C. A. equal to that
          amount, but the Association refused to adopt the work, or to be responsible for the funds.
          With this little support, the Committee of Ladies, organized, R. M. Coffin, Pres., Sarah
          Iliff Davis, Vice Pres., Rachel A. Mendenhall, Secretary, Mary Jackson, Treasurer. Several
          other ladies were soon added to our Board,^ being careful to only receive on the committee
          such as were thoroughly enlisted. Our first inmate was received 1st Mo., 1858. <note
            n="19">
            <p>1 Conspicuous among the whole-hearted co-workers in founding the Institution were the
              names, in addition to the above, Mrs. A. L. Samson, Mrs. IMartha Valentine, and Mrs.
              J. P. Agenbroad,</p></note> We employed Peter and Martha Bend, good kind-hearted
          Friends, to receive, and care for those whom we should admit, paying them a stated salary.
          The house was on what was then 7th Street, opposite a little Park. In a week, the house
          was full, we had seven under our care. This number would soon absorb all of our money. We
          found that the Y. M. C. A. was a hindrance instead of a help. Money was con- tributed
          freely to that Association, and the people were not willing to help us apart, so we
          withdrew, notified the Association of the fact, and received from them a very nice parting
          note.</p>
        <p>We made the matter one of special prayer and soon decided to launch out. We rented a
          house, advertised for furniture, provisions, etc. I sent an appeal, as President of " The
          Home Mission Association of Fnends of Indiana Yearly Meeting," to all of its branches,
          within a radius of 40 miles, and on the 12th of March, 1863, we took possession of No. 66
          South 6th Street. We opened it at 8 a. m., and by night the house was furnished, and wood
          and provisions enough to last for several months, and mone}" to assist in clothing, etc.
          Several gentlemen gave funds monthly, some as high as $50.</p>
        <p>We soon secured Mrs. Ransom as matron, enlarged our Board with ladies interested,
          procured employment for all able to work. As our movement was on a thoroughly religious
          basis, every measure was adopted, which was at ail likely to be beneficial. Sunday
          schools, prayer meetings, singing, music, gospel meet- ings, and instructions in the Bible
          by Christian men and women, to uplift them, comfort those in trouble and point all to
          Christ as one able and willing to save.</p>
        <p>We had many girls who had lived not wisely, and to all of these we held out helping
          hands. We afterwards secured Elmina Johnson, as matron, who developed into a most
          remarkable woman, not attractive in her appear- ance, but of remarkable adaptability for
          the work, pos- sessing great governing power with a large sympathetic heart and with a
          power to awaken the good, and in- spire with a desire for better life. She soon succeeded
          Mrs. Ransom, a woman good for the work. Mrs. John- son remained as superintendent until
          appointed to the position of assistant superintendent of "The Wom- en's and Girls'
          Reformatory, at Indianapolis, Indiana," where she remained until she died in the spring of
          1893. We realized that we must have a home of our own suit- ably arranged for our work,
          which had developed very rapidly. Charles Price, Sr., donated a town lot worth $450.
          Charles F. Coffin and two others gave $500 each, and many others contributed as they had a
          mind to give. A house was built. Charles Price superin- tended the building free of cost.
          The building cost about $8,000. We raised $5,000 and mortgaged the property for $3,000.
          Charles F. Coffin, Christopher Jackson, Abraham Gaar, and Stephen C. Mendenhall, who were
          most faithful allies, were appointed trustees. In all of this work my dear husband was
          most liberal in his contributions, and faithful in his service. The work, and that in
          connection with it, cost us on an average of $1,000 a year, and we ourselves had to supply
          what was lacking. The ladies on the Board were devoted in their service for the
          Institution. Sev- eral churches and quite a number of individuals fur- nished rooms. Our
          building consisted of a "Lock-up," a good airy hospital, a large nursery, well lighted,
          and about 20 bedrooms, besides the officers' rooms, a hall for guests, parlor,
          reception-room for the inmates in which to spend their evenings, with a library, and a
          large, airy workroom, kitchen, laundry, and dining- room. Our buildings were finally ready
          for occupation and we sent out word to all of our branches to bring supplies of food,
          bedding, clothing, groceries, provisions wood, etc., from their different neighborhoods.
          Dele- gates from each branch with forty wagonloads of firewood and provisions came
          bringing cooked food for a dinner. Eighty persons took dinner with the Board, speeches
          were made, and there was enough cooked food left over to last our large family for several
          days. "The Donation Day," as it was called, has continued to be a feature, I beHeve, ever
          since.</p>
        <p>An appeal was made to the County Commissioners for help to erect the building, the Board
          promising to receive such persons from the County Poor House, as they thought were fit for
          the institution. They re- sponded by a donation of $1,000.</p>
        <p>Judge George Holland, a noble-hearted man, had a case of a very interesting character,
          brought before him, a young woman for theft. He had our report of the condition of the
          Women's Prison at Jefferson- ville, which we had inspected under an appointment of
          Governor Conrad Baker and if possible to ascertain the true condition. As a result we had
          found a de- plorable condition existing. Judge Holland felt that he could not send this
          young woman there for it meant destruction. I was away from home at the time, and at the
          suggestion of my husband whom he consulted, he held the case until my return, when he came
          to see me. After hearing of the horrible condition which we had unearthed at
          Jeffersonville, he urged that we accept the provision of the new law passed by the
          Legislature of Indiana, authorizing the County Commissioners to legalize Homes for the
          Friendless when needful, and with the consent of the Board of Managers, to make them
          county reformatories, giving judges the option of sending female prisoners to these
          instead of to the State prison.</p>
        <p>Our Board at once consented and gave to Sarah IHfF Davis and myself authority to act on
          its behalf. We went to Centerville, which was then the County Seat, and had a meeting with
          the Commissioners, Daniel B. Crawford, Jonathan Baldwin, and Andrew Wiggins, which
          resulted in their approval. Articles of Incorpo- ration were taken out, one room was
          legalized as a county prison for women, they agreeing to bear the expense of $30 in
          fitting it up. The proceedings were approved by the Board of Managers. The work was
          completed, the judges notified, the day set for the trial. We had repeatedly visited the
          young prisoner in the county jail. Her case was a plain one well proved, and we urged a "
          plea of guilty," promising to go with her into court, to tenderly care for her and when
          she had served her sentence to stand by her. This met the approval of the judges. She was
          brought into court, plead guilty, was sentenced to two years, the lightest sentence of the
          crime. We were made Deputy Sheriffs and she was handed over to us by the Court to see that
          she was taken to Richmond and placed in our "County Prison for women." I gave her my arm,
          and with Sarah Iliff Davis on the other side we went to the station. The train was behind
          time, this gave oppor- tunity for the novel trio to be seen by a gaping crowd. We took her
          to the prison and locked her up, but in a few days, she was placed on her word of honor
          and freely mingled in the services of the Home. She soon accepted Christ as her Saviour.
          When her time ex- pired, a good home was provided for her, some distance from Richmond.
          She afterwards joined Friends and married respectably, and when I last heard from her she
          was very useful and filling her place in life credit- ably.</p>
        <p>Arrangements were afterwards made to take the city prisoners committed by the City
          Council, and some in- teresting cases were received. I could tell of many most interesting
          cases in the various branches that came under our care, but I have not the strens'th to
          write.</p>
        <p>I visited the Institution usually once a day and knew personally all the women and girls
          and children. Whilst I was president we kept in connection with all of the unfortunate
          girls for whom we had cared, and 50 per cent, were doing well. Many poor women and
          children were cared for. In connection with the Mission School and the Home I was
          instrumental in securing; homes for 63 children.</p>
        <p>I resigned my position in the Autumn of 18T1, as I was going; abroad for several months.
          I had sue- ceeded in effecting what I had hoped — a noble band of ladies for a Board, a
          great interest awakened throuo-hout the country for the errino;. a Ixome for the
          friendless. The Institution has continued to be suc- cessful and is doing much good to the
          present time.</p>

        <head>III. An Account of The Origin and Conduct of The Women's Prison and Girls' Reformatory At
          Indianapolis, Ind.</head>
      </div>
      <div type="chapter">
        <p>I a, aware that several articles have been written, in regard to the establishment of a
          Women's Prison and Girls' Reformatory, in Indiana, but it has been suggested that I write
          a short history of the origin, and the practical workings of that Institution, as my
          husband and myself are the only persons now living, who had anything to do with its
          beginning, or who know anything personally of the origin and completion of the
          Institution, outside perhaps of one or two mem- bers of the Legislature of Indiana who
          assisted in the passage of the bill for the establishment of the Reformatory.</p>
        <p>Since I860, we have been engaged more or less in visiting the State prisons, jails, and
          workhouses in the United States and Europe, as opportunity afforded. In every case where
          we applied, the privilege was freely granted us to preach the Gospel in the congregated
          as- sembly of prisoners, and freedom to visit them in their cells and converse with them
          on personal religion, or ad- minister comfort to those who needed it. The North- ern and
          Southern Penitentiaries of Indiana claimed our special attention.</p>

        <p>Our first work as far as we conceived it, was to can-y the glad tidings of the Gospel to
          those in bonds, and at first our minds did not grasp the greatness of the work on which we
          had entered, the needs and the great possibilities that were before us. We soon dis-
          covered that there was great need of reformation in the conduct of the prisons, and of the
          officers who managed them. No thought seemed to have entered the mind of the State
          Legislature that enacted the laws, or the officers who were working under them in the
          government of the prisons, as to the reformation of the prisoners. They were considered as
          given over to Satan, past re- demption, and "cooped up like so many wild animals."</p>
        <p>At the first National Prison Congress, which was organized by the Rev. E. C. Wines, D.
          D., and held in Cincinnati, Ohio, we brought before it the need of bet- ter prisons, and
          more attention to the reformation of the prisoners. One warden said to me, "Mrs. Coffin, I
          greatly admire you, your strength of character, and devotion to what you think is right,
          but you are not practical, you lack judgment, it can't be done, it is nonsense. I am an
          officer and I know it can't." I praise God I have lived to see it accomplished. We were
          interested in our State prisons and visited them very often, were always kindly received,
          made sugges- tions, which for the most part were put away in the pocket, but we sowed the
          seed.</p>
        <p>In the Winter of 1868, we received a request from Conrad Baker, then Governor of Indiana,
          to visit both prisons (Jeffersonville and Michigan City), and make a thorough
          investigation of their condition, and report to him, enclosing an official document of our
          appoint- ment, and requesting the officers in charge to render us every facility for the
          work.</p>
        <p>We first went to Jeffersonville, where the women con- victed of penal offenses were
          confined in a part of the prison set apart for them and under the same offi- cers as the
          men. The way was thoroughly opened, and we were kindly entertained. We were allowed to go
          un- attended in any part of the prisons. We visited the prisoners in their cells, talked
          with many, examined the prison in its various departments, and found things in a very bad
          condition, which we noted.</p>
        <p>We then separated, taking different portions of the prison, to talk with the prisoners.
          One of the prisoners, said to me, "I thank you, you are so welcome, we are all glad to
          hear you and your husband, you do us good, but do, for God's sake, do something for those
          poor women, their condition is terrible, it is perfectly awful," and then, after being
          careful that he was not over- heard, he told me that a number of the guards had keys to
          the women's prison and entered when they wished to gratify their lusts. If the women could
          be bought up they gave them trinkets or goods out of the government stores, if they did
          not yield. They were reported as incorrigible and stripped and whipped in the presence of
          as many as wished to look on. In the court of the prison there was a large reservoir where
          the men prisoners were obliged to bathe once a week. On Sabbath afternoons the women
          prisoners were brought out and compelled to strip, and thus exposed, required to run from
          the opposite side of the court and jump into the water, the guards using, if necessary,
          their lashes to drive them out to the howling amuse- ment of the guards and their friends
          who were per- mitted to be present; keeping it up as long as they pleased.</p>
        <p>There were children who had been born in the prison, their mothers having been there for
          several years. One baby we saw, but a few months old, the mother had been there for two
          years. This story was repeated by four men prisoners in different cells, who urged me to
          do something. When my husband and I met, we com- pared views and each had the same story.
          We said nothing to any one, except, in a private interview with the chaplain ; he was
          loath to say anything for fear he would lose his position, but finally admitted that it
          was all true and much more.</p>
        <p>After the books and records were examined as far as we could, we made our report to
          Governor Baker in confidence, stating that we were most kindly entertained by the
          officers, and every facility was given us for our investigation, and we felt exceedingly
          pained at the necessity of exposing the corruptions. After a long interview with Governor
          Baker, it was decided to keep our report for the time being confidential. And he would
          recommend a thorough investigation by the Leg- islature soon to meet and then if favorably
          acted on, he would give them our report as the basis of their investi- gation. This was
          done, a legislative committee was appointed, and in its investigation found things much
          worse than we had reported.</p>
        <p>Thus enecacred we saw the necessity of a women's prison placed entirely under the care of
          women. Gov- ernor Baker, one of the noblest of men, a man of warm sympathy and full
          confidence in the ability of woman, after consulting with us on several points drew up a
          bill for the establishment of a women's pnson. The class of women convicted of penal
          offenses being too small to warrant the erection of a building for them alone, and a
          reformatory for girls being badly needed, it was decided to combine the two under one
          manage- ment, the internal management of the prison to be under the control of a Board
          composed of two women and one man, and a Board of Managers composed of men, to erect
          buildings, prepare the grounds, etc., and to have charge of the finances. To the Women's
          Board was given the power to call for any books or papers, and to make an investigation of
          the finances and they were required to report the condition of the Institution annually to
          the Governor. All the officers in the build- ing were to be women.</p>
        <p>Up to the time of the preparation of this bill no one else was cocrpizant of the facts
          and conditions. It be- came necessary at this time to enlist others and make the matter
          public. Stoughton A. Fletcher, Jr., and James M. Ray were earnest supporters of the Board
          and afterwards were on the Board of Finance. Sarah J. Smith, who was the Matron for the
          Home of the Friendless in Indianapolis took hold vrith all the earnest enthusiasm and
          ability which so characterized her ef- forts in after years when superintendent of the
          Reformatory.</p>
        <p>When the committee appointed by the Legislature made its report, great indignation was
          aroused. The people of Indiana would not tolerate such treatment of women prisoners.
          Although they were violators of the law, and some of them most debased, still they were,
          in the minds of the people, entitled to protection. We ap- pealed to "The Representative
          Meeting of Indiana Yearly Meeting of the Society of Friends," and to many others who were
          known to be friendly to the measure, to use their influence with the members of both
          houses of the Legislature. Both men and women were actively engaged in working up a
          sentiment which would sus- tain the favorable action of the Legislature in passing the
          bill. I was accorded the privilege of speaking in the Senate on the condition of women's
          prisons and made an earnest appeal for the establishment of the Reformatory.<note n="20">
            Mrs. Sarah J. Smith, accompanied by the Governor of the State, and Mr. Charles F.
            Coffin, also went with Mrs. Coffin before the Legislature and made powerful appeals that
            produced telling effect.</note> Sarah J. Smith and myself spent sev- eral days lobbying
          amongst the men.</p>
        <p>Charles F. Coffin, Barnabas C. Hobbs, Francis W. Thomas, and many others, spent much time
          in working up an interest in the members sufficient to cause them to act. The bill was
          passed and became a law and went into force. May 13, 1869."<note n="21">
            <p>Mrs. Coffin was appointed a member of the Board by Governor Baker, immediately upon
              the passage of the Act, May 13th, 1869. The women on the Board were styled, " Board of
              Visitors." The Board proceeded at once to arrange for a building by the appointment of
              an architect. The building was completed and inmates received on October 8, 1873.</p>
            <p>This board was appointed for four years and Mrs. Coffin served until 1873, when she
              was appointed for another term by Governor Hendricks, and again on January 6th, 1877,
              was appointed to serve for a short term, until the organization of a new board could
              be effected which occured March 12th, 1877.</p></note></p>
        <p>The building's were erected on the ground where they now stand. <note n="22"><p>3
              1908.</p></note> When declared ready for occupancy, and the means provided for
          support, the seventeen women prisoners were brought from JefFersonville prison in chains,
          with a number of deputies to guard them. As they filed in on the grounds, they made quite
          a proces- sion. Sarah J. Smith had been appointed superin- tendent, and Elmina L. Johnson,
          assistant, both of whom had been serving as matrons for Homes for Friendless Women, Mrs.
          Smith in Indianapolis, and Mrs. Johnson in Richmond, both earnest Christians, women of
          rare executive ability and great power of govern- ment, and with good records as to
          management of the institutions they had served. The Board appointed by the Governor, and
          confirmed by the Senate, was com- posed of Rhoda M. Coffin, Adaline Roach and Lewis
          Jordan.</p>
        <p>Upon the arrival of the prisoners, the Board and the superintendents with a most peculiar
          sensation, stood in the hall to receive them, it being an untried field and one of great
          responsibility.</p>
        <p>The first to enter with her shackles on was SalHe Hubbard, a murderess. She and her
          husband had been convicted of the murder of a family of seven, who were migrating westward
          and stopped with them for the night. The husband was executed, and the wife was sentenced
          to prison for life at hard labor. She had been incarcerated for seventeen years in
          Jefferson- ville State Prison. She was a terror in the prison and exceedingly difficult to
          manage. The sheriff and two deputies brought her into the hall of the Administra- tion
          building heavily manacled, and said, " Mrs. Smith, where shall we take her?" "Set her
          down," replied Mrs. Smith, "and take off her shackles." He replied, "We can't — show us
          the cell, she is an awful woman." "Take off her shackles," Mrs. Smith said, "she is my
          prisoner, not yours." They did so, and as the chains fell, she took the prisoner in her
          arms, kissed her on her forehead and said, "I receive thee as my child, and will be a
          mother, and I know thou wilt be a good daugh- ter, let us pray, and ask Heaven to help
          us." They both knelt, Mrs. Smith's arms still around her. She plead for power to bring
          "the poor lost daughter home to God," and then rising with her prisoner, she said, "Come
          with me, dear, I have the loveliest little room for thee," and opening the door showed her
          her home for the remainder of her life. It was neatly furnished, with an iron bedstead,
          good husk mattress, a chair, small square table with a white muslin cover, a Bible and
          Hymn Book on it, a small looking-glass, the bed clothed in white, white curtain over the
          window, a locker for her use, and a pot of flowers in the window. All of the cells were
          similarly furnished.</p>
        <p>It was but a short time, until the prayer was an- swered. The prisoner became a new
          creature in Christ Jesus, old things passed away and a steady growth in grace was
          witnessed. She became quiet, gentle, unob- trusive, faithful in service, always on the
          alert to see that there was no plot to do harm. She was worth two guards, and yet had the
          love and confidence of the fellow prisoners. For fourteen years she has led a meek and
          humble life.</p>
        <p>This wonderful answer to prayer gave us great cour- age and confidence that our plan as
          organized was feasi- ble and could be carried out, and that the worst prisoner could be
          reformed.</p>
        <p>The Board of Trustees who had charge of erecting the buildings and of the financial
          management, only ser^'ed a few months until the Reformatory was fairly started. With these
          we had the most perfect harmony ; they were in full sympathy with the work.</p>
        <p>A new Board followed who had no conceptions of the real work intended. We soon found that
          the ma- chinery was cumbersome ; the men had the money, the women the internal management.
          Politics and patron- age were soon evident, politicians having the power of examining the
          books and being required by law to make a yearly report of the condition and of the en-
          tire management. We fulfilled our duty, and asked that the entire management be left to a
          Board of women, with all the powers of the other State Institutions. <note n="23">The
            provision for a mixed board did not work satisfactorily and the Legislature passed an
            act changing the management of the Institution to a board of three women.</note> The new
          Board of Trustees likewise petitioned for the abolition of the Women's Board, the whole to
          be placed in their hands, the Board of Trustees. Then came the contest. We rallied all our
          forces to influ- ence the Senators, — ex-Governor Conrad Baker, — whose time of service as
          Governor having expired, — and Thomas A. Hendricks, who was now the Governor, Sen- ator
          Bell of Fort Wayne, and others of that body, Charles F. Coffin, Nathaniel Carpenter, Jacob
          S. Wil- etts and wife, Sarah J. Smith, and many others whose names I cannot now recall,
          labored untiringly for plac- ing the Reformatory wholly in the hands of a Women Board of
          Managers, who should control and manage the finances, see to the cultivation of the
          ground, and in every way conduct, govern, and manage for the best in- terest of the State,
          and the control of reformation of the women and girls committed by law to the Institution.
          This was finally carried through the Legislature, and Rhoda M. Coffin, <note n="24"> Mrs.
            Cofiin was appointed President of this Board and served again tour years. She was again
            appointed by Governor Albert G. Porter, March 7th, 1881, and served till her removal
            from the State in 1884, making a total service of fifteen years under four Governors.
            During the entire period she held the office of President.</note> Ada, Roach, and Eliza
          C. Hendricks — wife of the Governor — were appointed by Governor Thomas A. Hendricks, and
          confirmed by the Senate according to law. On March 12, 1877, we entered upon the duties
          assigned us. We employed Anna Dunlap for secretary, who was a good bookkeeper, and her ac-
          counts were well and neatly kept. We were watched by suspicious eyes. One Senator said to
          Mr. Coffin when he was urcring- him to vote for the bill. " omen are sweet creatures and
          we Hke them, but they don't know anything about finances."</p>
        <p>One thing was decided, that we would not go into debt: another was, that every dime
          should go as far as possible, and that we would know where it was used. We were most
          fortunate in our officers, whose hearts were in their work, and both were most economical.
          We all believed that women and girls could be reformed and everythino- was directed to
          that end. If one was known to be under conviction for sin, everything stopped, if
          necessary, until that individual was brought to a saving: knowledge of Christ. Industrv.
          education, and religion, were made the basis of the work. The mind to be stored and
          trained to think, and food for thought to be supplied: hence there was reading aloud while
          they were at work, and a school for education was established. A part of the girls were in
          school in the morning and the remainder in the afternoon, and such of the prisoners as
          could not read, write, and knew nothing of arithmetic, were taught in school in the
          evening. The day was begun with reading the Holy Scriptures, song, and prayer. Every one
          was required in the morning to repeat a verse from the Bible and join in the Lord's
          Prayer. In the evening some interesting reading, closing the day with prayers and
          song.</p>
        <p>All the prisoners were required to learn all kinds of housework. We did not try to make
          money. We endeavored to reform them and to prepare them for usefulness in the world when
          they were discharged. The ladies of the Board received $160 per annum for their services,
          the amount intended only to pay for our necessary expenses. I regret that the salary was
          ever raised. The most of the salaries of the Board was used for a fund from which to draw,
          to procure for the inmates some extra needful things when discharged, or presents when
          they married, or after marriage arti- cles of wardrobe, keeping up an interest in them and
          their connection with the Institution. The superin- tendents likewise contributed a
          portion of their salaries and were required to correspond with them after they left, and
          as far as possible visit them once a year. This was faithfully accomplished, and was
          usually the only outing the officers had.</p>
        <p>The result was that a very large per cent, were doing well when I resigned from the
          Board. Both Governor Hendricks and Governor Williams, who succeeded Gov- ernor Hendricks,
          manifested the deepest interest in the Institution and were untiring in doing everything
          they could to aid us.</p>
        <p>It was prophesied by a number of the officers of the other State institutions, that vre
          would make a grand failure, and it was indeed a proud day when Governor James D. Williams,
          on visiting the Board said, " I have good news for you ladies, it will make you proud.
          This is the best managed institution in the State, the most economical, the best work
          done, and the reports are the best of any of the State institutions. I, this morning,
          signed an order that the Reports of the other State institutions should be made as yours
          are, and the books kept as yours are kept."</p>

        <head>IV: Annual Meeting of The National Prison Congress Of The United States Held in New York
          City, June 8, 1875.</head>
      </div>
      <div type="chapter">
        <p>This meeting was a noteworthy epoch in Mrs. Coffin's beneficent career. That year the
          Prison Congress considered a subject with which the States at large had heretofore had
          little to do — the well-being and treatment of women prison- ers. It also freed itself
          from the narrow tyranny of prejudice against women speaking in behalf of the outcast and
          abandoned her own sex, and extended an invitation to Mrs. Coffin to present a paper on a
          system for improving the condition of women prisoners. She readily as- sented to the
          request.</p>
        <p>She tells us in a brief narrative of the occasion the following:</p>
        <p>The Congress was composed of men and women of highest abilities, now awakened to the
          urgent need for somethincr to be done to meet the evil and ever-increasing tide of immoral
          and degraded women who swarm our cities ere it should gain such power as to menace our
          nation and our country.</p>
        <p>Very few present had faith that a woman could be reformed from such a course of life as
          that with which we were now grappling.</p>
        <p>Mine was the first paper on the subject to be pre- sented and I was the first woman to
          prepare and read a paper before the Congress. I was very timid about stepping out on
          unprepared soil and taking an en- tirely new position on this important subject, and when
          called for, the noble Rev. E. C. Wines, the leader of this great movement and President of
          the Convention, advanced to meet me as I with trembling steps made my way to the platform,
          and offering me his arm, said, "Don't be afraid, Mrs. Coffin, we will pray for you," and
          seating me by his side proposed to the audience a few moments of silent prayer. Fear
          vanished, and I read my paper, taking entirely new ground, one that had never before been
          taken. It met with great ap- plause and was recommended for adoption.</p>
        <p>This paper proved the foundation of the Reform Movement which has become so nearly
          universal in our country — the reformation of the criminal, instead of punishment.</p>
        <p>What should be the System of Treatment ap- plied to the Inmates of a Female Prison.</p>
        <p>The proper treatment of prisoners will depend en- tirely upon the object that is to be
          attained. If pun- ishment be the prime object, then the more severe the treatment, the
          more uncomfortable the position, the more completely we can surround her with everything
          that is loathsome, the sooner will the object be accomplished ; and when her time is
          expired, she will be again thrown upon society as a moral cancer, with her evil tendencies
          intensified and her powers for evil greatly increased.</p>
        <p>If rehabilitation be the object, then all the means should be used that will tend to
          elevate, m.culd the character, and strengthen her better nature and her womanly
          powers.</p>
        <p>The position that we shall take in this essay will be, that reformation should be the
          prime object: that the protection of society is more thoroughly effected by reformation
          than it can possibly be by the severity of punishment. But in order to effect this,
          punish- ment becomes more or less an adjunct, for the prisoner must be deprived of liberty
          and placed under subjec- tion. The State takes the place of a parent, and whilst
          administering punishment for past offenses or crimes, should seek to subdue and remould
          the character by throwing around her those influences which "vill awaken a new life, new
          thoughts, new aspirations, so that when she leaves the prison she may come forth fitted to
          take a position of usefulness.</p>
        <p>It will be admitted by all who have turned their at- tention to the reformation of
          prisoners, that the proper construction of the building is essential to crcod disci-
          pline. A comparatively small defect in the plan of a building may render abortive all
          efforts for a thorough system of discipline. In order to have a perfect system for the
          treatment of convicts in a female prison, the building" should be so arranged as to render
          every facility for safety, convenience, discipline, industry, the pro- motion of health,
          and the thorough reformation of the inmates or convicts. They should be solid, plain
          build- ings, adapted to the purpose. Not so much attention given to mere architectural
          display (as we often see in State institutions), but more to durability, convenience and
          adaptation to the work desired to be accomplished.</p>
        <p>The women's prison should be entirely under the con- trol of women, from the Board of
          Managers to the lowest office. Recent developments have proved that there are those who
          are fully competent to conduct a female prison with entire success financially, morally
          and religiously.</p>
        <p>If a board of gentlemen for the financial management of a prison cannot be dispensed
          with, there should be a board of women managers, to whom should be entrusted the power to
          have in connection with the superintend- ent, the entire control and supervision of the
          con^^cts.</p>
        <p>The appointment of all subordinate officers should rest with the superintendent of the
          prison, subject to the confirmation of the board. No subordinate officer should have the
          power to Inflict punishment. The disci- pline should be firm, and the penalty decided and
          cer- tain, but with the right kind of officers little punish- ment would be needed. A
          warden of one of the State prisons, who was noted for the frequency and severity of his
          punishment, assured the writer that with the right kind of officers in his prison
          containing several hundred men, the need of Inflicting severe punishment would be
          rare.</p>
        <p>Flogging and shower baths should never be allowed in a female prison. Degradation from
          position, privation of food, withdrawal of liberties, with the very- guarded use of the
          dark cell, for a short period in ex- treme cases, will usually be found sufficient in
          hands of rightly qualified officers. Too great importance, therefore, cannot be attached
          to care in the selection of these. Ever}' one conversant with prison discipline knows how
          much depends on having the right official in the right place. They should be women of
          sterling integi'ity, undoubted piety, tact, quickness of discern- ment, appreciation of
          character, apt to teach, possessing powers of government, a living example of divine grace
          over a consecrated soul. Thus the convicts have con- tinually before them an example to
          follow — a goal to strike for.</p>
        <p>Severe punishment or fear may deter a woman from open violation of rules, and may produce
          an apparent, but never effect a real reformation, the debasing effects, as a inile, only
          tending to sink her deeper and com- plete the destruction of her self-respect : and
          without self-respect she can not be reformed. To effect her refoiTnation she must be
          elevated. Hope, therefore, should be instilled and kept alive in the mind and heart of the
          convict, being constantly strengthened by some object yet to be attained. Women are great
          imitators, easily influenced by stronger minds, hence the wisdom of surrounding the
          prisoners constantly with the hal- lowed Christian influence of their own sex.</p>
        <p>Both common sense and reason teach that woman is the best adapted to have charge of, meet
          the wants, and supply the needs of female prisoners. She alone can understand the
          susceptibilities, temptations, weak- nesses, and the difficulties bv which such prisoners
          are surrounded; she alone can enter into the innermost recesses of their being and
          minister thereunto.</p>
        <p>With such officers, many of the rules and regulations may be left discretionary with the
          superintendent, un- der the proper supervision of the Board of Managers. The prison should
          be as nearly as possible a well regu- lated household, each member receiving such
          discipline and training as may be peculiarly needful to her.</p>
        <p>The prisoners received into our prisons, as a class, are ignorant, reflect but little,
          have limited powers of thought, and fewer avenues of resources for develop- ment. If the
          maxim be true, that ignorance is the par- ent of vice and crime, it is of the utmost
          importance that this want be mict. The mind should be cultivated, and should also be
          supplied with the food needful for its proper nourishment. Regular, systematic instruction
          should be given if possible. Attention should be paid to this, so far, at least, as to
          have evening schools. The education should be practical, and have strict refer- ence to
          the future. By such culture she would not only be the better fitted for the position
          intended for her to occupy by our great Creator, when liberated, but whilst, in prison,
          her mind would be diverted in a large measure from the gloomy thoughts and constant
          dwelling upon the past, and what she considers her hard fate.</p>
        <p>Both education and religion are forces of incalculable power. But whilst education tends
          to inspire self- respect by quickening and strengthening the intellect, developing ideas,
          and furnishing new food for thought, religion is the only power that is able to overcome
          the evil of the heart. Therefore, religious instruction is the greatest instrumentality
          that can be used in the regeneration and refomiation of convicts. In order to effect this,
          every right and proper means should be sought out and made available in endeavoring to
          bring them to Christ, that through faith in His blood, their hearts may be cleansed and
          they made new creatures. With such a foundation upon which to build — with a Christ life
          in the soul, and with the impartation of Divine grace, we have much to hope for. In order
          to effect such reformation we must combine with thorough religious culture, strict moral
          discipline. In winning souls to Christ, as well as in teaching the practical duties of a
          Christian life, outside influences may be very useful. Men and women of purity of life and
          devotion of heart to their Lord, will be a great power. Thought being presented by a new
          mind in a new phase, is often productive of great results.</p>
        <p>The prisoners on the Sabbath should be kept occupied with something interesting or
          profitable, with singing, reading, pleasant conversation on topics of interest and profit.
          Chapel services should be regularly held. Prayer meetings are an important adjunct, in
          which the convict should feel that she has the right to partici- pate in songs of praise,
          prayer or experience. Sabbath schools are an acrencv not to be icmored, but will be found
          to be invaluable aids in awakening; to a new life and strencrtheninc^ the moral and
          Christian character.</p>
        <p>One of the great mistakes of the present day and a prolific source of evil, is the
          too-prevailing idea that labor is deg-radino: to woman: that to be eng-ao-ed in the
          various departments of woman's work is beneath the dignity of a lady of culture. The
          poorer classes im- bibe the spirit of their more favored sisters, ignore the various
          avenues open to them for procuring an honest livelihood, and thus become an easy prey to
          the tempter. Very few women who are competent and willing to work are ever found in
          prison. Idleness and pride engender vice. Labor is essential to reformation. It is not
          only a means of support, but an auxiliary to virtue. Every- thing in a prison should point
          to the advantage of in- dustry. Unless the convict is taught to labor and ac- quire habits
          of industry, and a love for and pride in some kind of work, she will be almost sure to
          fall. She should be taught to do well all the duties of house- wifery, and, if possible,
          some kind of trade — a trade which could be carried on without machinery — so that w^hen
          she leaves the prison, she goes forth equipped and girded with the power of supporting
          herself hon- estly and virtuously. Habits of cleanliness and order should be enforced, and
          indolence or laziness severely punished, if they cannot be overcome by milder treat-
          ment.</p>
        <p>The food should be plain, but good, and of sufficient variety to ensure health. Outdoor
          recreation is essen- tial to the health as well as to the uplifting and re- formation of
          the convict. Both diet and recreation may be made powerful agencies in the hands of a wise
          and judicious officer. Every prison should have a well selected library of religious,
          moral, historical, and other works that may be selected, which will have a tendency to aid
          in the work of remolding.</p>
        <p>To fit prisoners for entrance again into the world, and to combat evil with its
          temptations, they should be tested. This may be done by increased liberty, and added
          responsibilities. The system should be so ar- ranged that the latter part of the
          imprisonment should be merged into liberty. The restraints should in a meas- ure be
          gradually removed, and so far as may be, the prisoner placed in ordinary life, with trust
          reposed and an opportunity given to meet and overcome temptation. This, perhaps, can be
          accomplished by advance of posi- tion to powers and trust. The reformation of woman being
          the prime object, the liistory of her character and the registry of her crime, open to
          public inspection^ is highh^ objectionable, for her character is so exceed- ingly
          delicate, and her reputation so very difficult to regain when once lost, that everything
          should be avoided in her treatment or punishment that would impede or retard her
          recovery.</p>

        <p>Women's Reformatories, Police Matrons, Etc.<note n="25"> From the printed Report of the
            Prison Congress.</note></p>
        <p>The questions which are to occupy the attention in this section of the National Prison
          Association this afternoon, are of vital importance, affecting as they do the life and
          vigor of the nation, for its strength lies in the virtue of its women, and the purity of
          marital life.</p>
        <p>In every country of the civilized world there is appar- ent at the present time an
          increasing interest in prisons and prison reform — a far more intelligent line of thought
          is observable. As the Investigation has prog- ressed, the condition of women prisoners has
          claimed more serious attention. During the last decade the sub- ject has been presented in
          some form to the most of our legislative assemblies, either by gubernatorial mes- sages,
          bills, or petitions, varying In degree in propor- tion to the enlightened public opinion
          upon the subject, but all bearing the same impress, to wit: an awakened consciousness to
          the danger that is threatening the life of our nation by the alarming increase of crime
          among the women and girls of our land, and the rapid in- crease of a criminal class.</p>
        <p>It is cause for encouragement that a great change has been wrought in the public mind by
          the combined forces of the benevolent, the philanthropist, and the Christian, who, seeing
          the danger that threatened their homes and their country, have laid aside their preju-
          dices, thrown down the barriers which have hitherto separated them, and joining hand to
          hand have united in one grand noble effort to stop the ravages of the in- vading foe. Some
          progress has been made. Instead of our public men taking hold In a sort of perfunctory
          way, as was the case during the first agitation of the subject, there are many of them now
          found foremost in the ranks, who, with a hearty good will, lend their aid In the solution
          of this difficult problem. As yet. In but few of the states has there been much advance
          made in the establishment of separate prisons or reforma- tories for women or girls, under
          the control of women. Some progress has been made in a few of the states in placing women
          in more advanced positions in regard to reformatorv or industrial schools for skirls, but
          none of the states. I believe, except Indiana and Massachusetts, have shown their faith by
          their works, by establishing State prisons of a reformatory character, and placing them in
          the hands of women. Indiana leads the way in the completeness of her confidence in woman's
          powers. Her embryonic faith enacted a law for the establish- ment of a reformatorv for
          women and girls : erected a building, and appointed a financial board composed of men, and
          a philanthropic board, composed of women and a male physician, but all the officers for
          the interior government of the reformatory, to be composed of women, selected and
          appointed by the superintendent, who herself is appointed by the Board of Managers. The
          embryo grew and developed until the completion of a full-m-own faith became manifest about
          ten vears since by the transfer of the reformatory to a Board of Managers composed of
          three women, clothed with full powers, as in other State Prisons. As the full-grown faith
          began to bear fruit, some of the seeds thereof were carried by some unseen power over the
          States of Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York (States with wealth and intel- ligence, and who
          should have opened their hearts to receive it), and lodged in the fertile soil of
          Massachu- setts, which State is always found in the foremost ranks in efforts for fallen
          humanity. Soon there sprung up from that seed, that grand, noble institution known as the
          Reformatory Prison for Women, but her faith in woman's capacities is not yet perfected, as
          is evidenced by the fact that her Board of Commissioners is com- posed of three men and
          two women. Nevertheless, it is a grand institution — an honor to the State. Of the
          benefits arising from the above named Institutions, I shall speak more fully further
          on.</p>
        <p>The need of separate prisons, or reformatories, for women and girls, under the absolute
          care and supervi- sion of vromen officers, should be apparent to all, and is one of the
          most important questions that will claim the attention of the National Prison Association.
          With the exception of the two States above mentioned, female convicts are confined in the
          same State Prison as men, in a small department either in the basement, attic room, or
          some other circumscribed place, as a rule poorly ventilated and illy adapted to any
          reformatory meas- ures. The prisoners are usually employed in washing the clothing of the
          men prisoners, or in making or mending them — a custom deletenous to the women, and no
          advantasre whatever to the State, for the invalid corps in the men's prison is just fitted
          for that kind of work, and would be benefitted by having it to perform. Thus kept in a
          narrow, contracted place, no systematic plan can be carried out. Female prisoners, as a
          rule, are ignorant of any system or discipline. Provision should be made for a thorough,
          systematic training in all kinds of housewifery, in order to fit them for an honest
          livelihood upon their release. No reformation can be effected without industry and
          systematic labor. It is probable that all of our prisons where women are confined have a
          matron, who has the oversight of the female prisoners, but that officer is usually
          selected not so much for her peculiar fitness for the place, and known success in
          reformation, as for some favoritism or per- sonal preferment. They have but little power,
          have no control over the finances, and therefore cannot de- velop any plans for the
          reformation of the convicts. To expect them to do so under such circumstances would be to
          require them to make bricks without straw.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the thought of reformation does not enter into the discipline of such prisons.
          Two points only are taken into consideration : the punishment and preven- tion from escape
          of the. prisoners. However exalted the warden may be, and earnest and conscientious to do
          his whole duty toward the female prisoners, the class from whom he must select his
          subordinate officers are rarely men who are noted for their virtue or their im- maculate
          purity. The guards in some of the prisons (it may be in most) have keys to the women's
          prison, and in somie cases have keys to their cells. The results in some instances have
          been most terrible : where help- less women, — incarcerated criminals we grant. — but not
          alwavs debased or thorouo;hlv deo^raded. It mav be some of them, with a love for fine
          dress, jewelry, etc., and without the means to gratify it have been tempted to steal from
          their employers, and have been arrested, tried, and convicted of larceny, and sent for a
          term to the State prison. Their reputation is gone, but their virtue is still presers'ed,
          and their sense of virtue is as keen as any woman's. They are placed in such an in-
          stitution and may be forced to minister to the lust of the officers. They are powerless,
          they are only convicts, and have no redress.</p>

        <p>I am not drawing here imaginary pictures, or stat- ing something that might possibly
          occur, but giving you a faint sketch of what has actually taken place within my own
          personal knowledge in this, our country. Could I convey to j^ou some idea of the terrible
          abuses which have been unveiled in the investigations which my husband and myself have
          made into the condition of our prisons and prison system, you would at once be convinced
          of the need of some reform as regards the case of female criminals. I would not for a
          moment convey to you the thought that this is a picture of that which exists in every
          prison where women criminals are confined under the care of men. We have some noble
          wardens in our State prisons, who would gladly better the condition of the female
          prisoners if they could; but with all their other duties, it is impossible for them to
          bring to bear their powers in the work of reformation which should be carried on in a
          woman's prison.</p>
        <p>Again, men cannot reform debased women. Most women who have descended so low as to be
          incarcerated in a prison under sentence, have lost self-respect and the finer
          sensibilities of their character. Many of them are women of easy virtue, having been
          debased b}^ men and accustomed to use their powers to influence them for evil. Hence men
          are at a disadvantage in under- taking to deal with them. It is also attended with great
          danger to themselves. First, the demoralizing effect of such influence on their own lives
          and character. Second, their reputation, although it may be of the purest and most
          exalted, is placed in the hands of the vilest and the lowest, and may be blasted
          irretrievably. The cost is too great for pure-minded men, and any other kind should not be
          permitted to enter the walls of such a prison for humanity's sake. Hence the need of a
          women's and girls' reformatory to be under the entire supervision of women. To this some
          female con- victs object. They greatly prefer being under the management of men. When the
          female prisoners were removed from the Southern prison, JefFersonville, Ind., to the Women
          and Girls' Reformatory at Indianapolis, they protested vigorously against the change.
          They, for certain favors, had been allowed privileges ; money had been given in some
          cases, to others liquor and to- bacco. And when these perquisites were all withdrawn, and
          they were placed in the pure atmosphere of God- fearing women, the change was not
          agi'eeable to them — strong proof of the need of a separate prison.</p>
        <p>Let us examine some of the objections. The strong- est one in the mind of the tax-payer
          is that there are so few women criminals in the different States, that we cannot afford to
          erect and sustain another institution. We ask why is it there are not more women and
          2:irls sent to prison.^ It is not because there are not more criminals, for there are
          thousands of women and o^irls in the United States who should be in a woman's or girl's
          reformatory. In the city of Chicago alone there were about 8.000 arrests of women and
          o-irls during; the past year, all of whom passed through the station- houses. A large
          portion of these should have received a maximum sentence subject to conditional release
          and been committed to a woman's prison or reformatory, to be kept under training and
          sur^'eillance until reformed.</p>
        <p>If a woman or girl is arrested, convicted of crime and sent to our workhouses or
          penitentiaries, it only adds a stigma without any benefit. Her labor is not remun-
          erative. There are no reformatory measures — she as- sociates with those deeper in crime
          than she is herself and in most cases comes out vastly worse than when she entered. Hence
          many judges and juries, when young women or those even more hardened in crime are brought
          before them, cannot find it in their hearts to send them to such prisons as we have; they
          are, therefore, in many cases, either acquitted, let off with a light fine, or dis- missed
          on promise of good behavior. Thus they have the stigma of having been arrested and tried
          with no corresponding benefit to them or the State. Said a leading judge: "I have had
          twenty such cases during the past year, every one of whom I should have sent to a woman's
          prison, but I could not send them to such as we have." Many others have borne the same
          testi- mony.</p>
        <p>Another objection urged is that women superinten- dents are not capable. We answer
          unhesitatingly there are women in every State of the Union with as great capabilities for
          the proper and successful conduct of such institutions, financially, morally, and
          religiously, as can be found among the men. Indiana has thor- oughly proved this. The four
          consecutive Governors, under whose administration the board of managers (all ladies), have
          served, have borne the same striking testi- mony, viz. : that it Is the best managed of
          any of the institutions in the State, the most careful and economi- cal in Its
          expenditures, thorough In its discipline, and successful in the work of reformation. Over
          80 per cent, of those who have passed through the reformatory are now doing well. The
          prison that can reform criminals, and send them out better men and women, law- abiding
          instead of law-breaking, producers instead of consumers, is doing the best thing for the
          State, mor- ally and financially.</p>
        <p>The object of all prison discipline should be reforma- tion. In order to effect this,
          reformation must first take place in the public mind. The idea of prisons and their
          purpose in the public mind at the present day does not differ materially from that which
          pervaded the minds of the people during the reign of the ancient monar- chies of Egypt,
          that of detention and punishment. Reformation implies re-forming or making over — a
          complete remodeling. This should be the prime object in every prison. If men and women so
          conduct them- selves as to be unfitted for liberty, unsafe to the inter- est of the state
          or communit}', and their incarceration is necessary, it is prima facie evidence that those
          indi- viduals need reforming or making over, and vrhen the State takes the position of a
          parent, and assumes con- trol over them, and the right to punish, she also as- sumes the
          responsibility of the care of those persons, and is bound to bring to bear such discipline
          as may be reformatory in its character, and to use all possible means to surround them
          with all of those influences that may be helpful in producing that change.</p>
        <p>For woman the means used should be of an uplifting character. She can not be refoiTned
          until hope is kindled and her self-respect in a measure established. In order to effect
          this all of the officers should be God- fearing women of the purest type, who have learned
          to govern themselves, presenting to the prisoners an example to follow. The discipline
          should be firm and decided. The three principal adjuncts — education, in- dustry, and
          religion — should all be brought to bear freely upon the character. There should be
          perfect system in the industrial department, and all of them should be taught all kinds of
          housewifery to fit them for service, a position which the most of them will have to
          occupy. They should be made to pass through all the grades and perform the work well, and
          when their time expires they have the m.eans of an honest livelihood within their
          power.</p>
        <p>The training and discipline of the mind is invaluable; to be taught to think, to reason
          from cause to effect. As a class they think or reason but little, hence all should have
          the privilege of school a portion of each day, if capable of learning. All should be
          taught to read understandingly, for the mind will act, will feed on something, and should
          be supplied with the right kind of food and trained to appropriate it.</p>
        <p>Religion is an important adjunct, while industry is absolutely essential, and the
          discipline and training of a school is so beneficial for the mind, yet a personal saving
          knowledge of God through Christ Jesus is the prime factor in the reformation of a convict.
          Hence the need of church services. Sabbath schools, and prayer meetings, good books to
          read, and a variety of labor. With these all combined in the hands of conscientious women
          of financial and executive ability and the power of controlling others, a large number of
          the women and girls who are now floating from one pnson to another might be reformed.</p>
        <p>The Indiana Reformatory for women and girls is reformatory in its character. It is
          composed of two branches entirely distinct and separate, yet under the same board of
          managers and superintendent. The one is penal, to which are sent those who are convicted
          of crime, such as murder, manslaughter, horse-stealing, arson, counterfeiting, forgery,
          and larceny, for all of which crimes prisoners have been received in that insti- tution as
          in any other State prison. The other depart- ment is for girls young in sin, and those
          exposed in the midst of evil. These are committed during minority and may go out on good
          behavior or "ticket-of-leave," under the surveillance of the board. The Massachu- setts
          Reformatory has the same system of "appren- ticeship " but rather better developed. Every
          effort is made for their reformation.</p>
        <p>But, says the sceptic, a woman who has sunk so low as to come under the action of the
          law, is beyond refor- mation. Much is said about the depths to which women may fall, that
          their powers of corruption are innnense, far in excess of the men. While we always have
          claimed that women are equal to men, we have never yet ad- mitted the point that she was
          superior to him in ability to sin or to entangle others. In reply to the objec- tion that
          a bad woman can not be reformed, we refer you to the marvelous success of the Indiana
          Reforma- tory, which had for its head for many years, Sarah J. Smith, one of the noblest
          women and most successful prison officers which the world has ever produce^.</p>
        <p>Station-houses and city prisons are places of almost unmitigated evil. Through the
          station-houses of large cities there pass annually many thousands of prisoners, many of
          whom are exceedingly vile and corrupt beyond description. Among these are thousands of
          women and girls, who have grown hardened in crime, and vie with the men in their
          profanity, obscenity, and lust; others are young girls, upon whose faces still may be seen
          the bloom of youth. Others, so young as scarcely to conceive of what crime is, having been
          abducted or en- ticed, under some specious charm, and ruined before they had any
          conception of womanhood. Again others, the victims of misguided confidence, full of shame
          and with hope blighted, rushing helplessly or madly along down the vortex of crime and
          misery. Others are shop girls, who through love of dress or from pressing pov- erty, have
          been tempted to purloin from their employ- ers. Again, some who are wrongfully accused by
          some thoughtless or hard-hearted employer are thrust into the station house to await
          arraignment before the police court, in some cases friendless and alone. All these are
          hustled together, often so crowded that there is not room, even so much as to sit on the
          floor, while all around their open cells, shut off only by bars, very frequently may be
          seen one surging, sickening mass of men and boys, filling the corridor contiguous to the
          women's cells, and pressing so close to the bars as to converse freely in such language as
          would make any one blush to hear it. There also are received destitute women, strangers,
          who have no place to sleep and are given shelter for the night, also lost children. In the
          police stations of Chicago during the past two months [1884] over 600 lost children were
          cared for until re- stored to their homes. Throughout the United States, with but few
          exceptions, those station-houses are under the care of men, some of whom have received
          their posi- tions for political services rendered to the dominant party, and but few of
          them on account of peculiar merit for the position, and until quite recently there were no
          matrons in any of the station-houses. But through the efforts of the ladies of the Woman's
          Chris- tian Temperance Union matrons are now permitted to have a place in the
          station-houses of som.e of the cities of nine different States. In some they are permitted
          by sufferance only, philanthropic ladies paying their salaries, whilst in others they are
          now employed by the municipal authorities to stay in the stations and have some care over
          those arrested by the police or received for the night, such as lost cliildren, destitute
          women, etc. These matrons have no power, except a moral one. This step at first met with
          strong opposition from the police, but many of them now fully acknowledge the benefits
          derived therefrom through every department of the prison. This is a move in the right
          direction, but far short of what it should be. Desirous of seeing the working; of this
          system, I visited recently one of the police courts of the city of Chicago, where was
          revealed to my startled vision the fact as above stated, of near 8000 arrests of women and
          girls during the past year who had passed through the station-houses of Chicago alone.
          Upon pressing my way into the court-room I found congregated, about 250 persons, composed
          of a few weeping mothers, or anxious-looking fathers, or brothers and sisters, but by far
          the larger portion of them, a lecherous, low mass such as daily gather into the police
          courts and feed upon the filthy garbage which is there presented. Large numbers were
          arraigned of all classes. In the midst of it all stood the noble matron, her very presence
          a benediction. As the fe- male prisoners were arraigned she drew near the bar. One among
          the many was a young girl, about nineteen, arraigned for drunkenness, a bright, handsome
          young face, not inured to crime. She had never been before the court ; modest and
          diffident she was overwhelmed with shame. "V\nien her trial was ended the matron took her
          by the hand and gave such words of encouragement and hope as only she could do, and at
          once sought to devise means for her reformation. Another case fol- lowed. A young woman,
          well-dressed, arraigned for larceny, in a house of ill-repute. The matron again stood by
          the bar, facing the spectators, and here the value of her presence was most perceptible as
          a re- straining power over the attorneys and others, causing the trial to proceed with
          becoming decency. Two little school girls, not yet in their teens, were brought as
          witnesses against a fortune-teller who had beguiled them into her den. There the matron
          stood by to pro- tect those little children. And thus I might go on giv- ing you instance
          after instance of the good effect of her presence in that court-room, but I have just
          lifted the veil to give you a glimpse of the work that is needed and the force of a
          God-fearing woman. Her oppor- tunities even thus limited are great. Sometimes an un-
          sophisticated girl is brought in who has come from the country in search of higher wages;
          she is alone, her means exhausted, and she is exposed to want; and save for the matron's
          motherly sympathy and counsel, might be ruined. And again, there are those poor, unfor-
          tunate, misguided creatures, who, weary of sin, may sometimes be reached by her loving
          tenderness and sym- pathy, and turned from their course into a path of virtue.</p>
        <p>There are some work-houses or houses of correction which are well managed and the women
          arranged for in a remarkable manner, considering the difficulties to be overcome, such as
          the House of Correction at Chi- cago under the excellent super^-ision of Mr. Felton. This
          is one of the best institutions of its kind in the United States. But the work of
          reformation of the women rarely enters into the constitution of such insti- tutions,
          neither does it seem to be among the possibili- ties, and the officers, with few
          exceptions, would be glad to be rid of them, that their energies might be directed to the
          development and training of men. In some of the work-houses the men and women work to-
          gether on the streets or stone pile, and but little restriction is exercised over their
          cormiiingling together.</p>
        <p>Some of the county jails are a disgrace to civiliza- tion, and the most of them are
          schools of crime. But I can not enlarge upon these in this opening address, but trust
          others may follow, and be able to throw some light upon their proper construction,
          management, etc. In some houses of correction, workhouses, and county jails, matrons are
          employed but with no power except such as she receives from the warden or jailer. In every
          place, therefore, whether police station, workhouse, house of correction, or county jail,
          where female prisoners are incarcerated, there should be a woman's department under the
          control of a capable, middle- aged Christian women, who have full powers in every way. The
          finances needful for the conduct of such a department should be placed in their hands.
          There should be a thoroughly organized graded system of re- formatories, with a
          supervising board empowered to transfer and adjust the inmates from one institution to
          another as might in their judgment seem best for the good of all; buildings should be
          erected in each State, inexpensive, but fitted to the work to be done. Laws should be so
          amended as to cause the arrest of keepers of brothels and houses of assignation and
          prostitutes, street-walkers, and drunkards, and upon conviction thereof they should be
          sent to a woman's reformatory prison for not less than one nor more than two years for the
          first offense, and upon second conviction should receive a maximum sentence, subject to
          conditional release on giving full evidence of reformation.</p>
        <p>The work for discharged prisoners is in its infancy. In a few of the large cities there
          are organized associ- ations for the care of discharged female prisoners. In New York
          there is, I learn, an excellent organization, which is doing good work. The Dedham Home in
          Massachusetts for discharged prisoners, supplements the work of the reformatory prison for
          women in afford- ing a temporary home for discharged prisoners until they can obtain
          employment. Especially is this asso- ciation valuable in caring for discharged prisoners
          with young children, for whom it is so difficult to find employment. Their board is paid
          for a few weeks from the State appropriation for that purpose. But, owing to the admirable
          plan adopted by the reformatory of providing for them homes previous to the expiration of
          their sentences, the number needing such a home is de- creasing annually. The Indiana
          Reformatory for Women and Girls provides homes for all who will accept, and most of them
          are very grateful for such provi- sion, and as their time of release draws near special
          care is taken to fit them for their departure, and a correspondence is kept up with them
          after their release, for their encouragement, and but few of them disappear from our
          sight. This work, I trust, will claim the special attention of this conference.</p>

        <head>VI. The National Prison Association Meeting in De- troit, Michigan, October 18th,
          1885.</head>
      </div>
      <div type="chapter">
        <p>A large number of representative and prom- inent persons of our country interested in
          prison reform, met in Detroit on the above date to discuss the needs and methods of such
          reform.</p>
        <p>The Hon. James B. Campbell of the Michi- gan Supreme Bench stated in his address of
          welcome "that the object of the association was not to make easy the life of the prisoner,
          but rather to prevent others to join with him, and lead him away from his criminal
          practices. He emphasized the importance of taking- g-ood care of our prisoners as a public
          duty. He believed in a better knowledo^e of the criminal law bv society in general and
          desired justice in the deal- ings with prisoners and supposed criminals. Xo prisoner
          should be placed in such surroundings that he be made a criminal. He cited known in-
          stances of honest men being arrested and sent to jail by county justices simply because
          there hap- pened to be no one present who could vouch for them, and argued for the
          simplification of the criminal laws. He recalled the fact that the Detroit Public Library
          was formerly enlarged and sustained by means of fines for minor offenses, but such method
          of punishment has been almost entirely abolished. Having but imprisonment only for a
          punishment bands together all crim- inals — great and small, and it may in the end require
          an increased effort to suppress crime.</p>
        <p>Ex-President Rutherford B. Hayes, presiding, after returning thanks for the welcome
          extended, in the course of his remarks said: "The end aimed at in legal punishment, so far
          as concerns criminals, is not vengeance, not mercy, not abso- lute justice. It is the
          welfare of society. Who- ever wishes to protect society from crime will find upon reading
          the extensive programme pre- pared for this Congress that it embraces among its topics the
          punishment and reformation of criminals, the prevention of crime, and the far- reaching
          and enduring influences of labor, of education, and of religion.</p>
        <p>Among the topics discussed was Women's Prisons. Mrs. Coffin was introduced to the audi-
          ence and by previous request, presented the sam.e paper (see paper just preceding) that
          she read before the Prison Congress held at Sara- toga Springs in 1884. This paper,
          together with her suggestions, was received with marked approval and interest.</p>

        <p>The following paper along similar lines was written by request for another occasion.</p>
        <p>Convict Labor Issues Written by request</p>
        <p>ONE of the most important questions which should claim the attention of the benevolent,
          philanthropic, and Christian people of the land is how to arrest the increase of crime
          among the women, for without a high standing of rectitude, honor, and purity among her
          women, no nation can flourish. The State of Illinois has the alarming revelation now
          before her that in the city of Chicago alone there were during the last year about eight
          thousand arrests of women. This does not indi- cate that there were eight thousand
          individual women involved, but there were so many violations of law by women of sufficient
          flagrancy as to warrant arrest. Many of these float from the streets to the courts, and
          vice versa : others from streets to prison and from prison to the streets. It needs no
          argument to show the result of this on a community, each repetition only adding to their
          powers for evil. Neither is there need of arguments to prove the necessity of a change in
          our prison system and the laws which produce such results. The laws should be so amended
          as to be pre- ventive and reformatory in their execution.</p>
        <p>There should be provision made by the state, first, for prevention, such as is
          contemplated in the effort which is now being made for securing a "state training school
          for dependent and wayward girls." To this no violator of law should ever be sent. Such an
          institution should be preventive, not reformatory. Another great need of the State of
          Illinois is a "women's and girls' reformatory " for violators of the law. An effort was
          made during the sessions of the last legislature for the establishment of such an
          institution and a bill introduced, but I am sorry to say it died of inanition. Both of
          these Institutions should be built and supported by the state, the control to be under the
          care of boards of managers composed exclusively of women. The finances, education,
          Industry, and religious influences all to be under their control, officered throughout by
          capable women of pure hearts, pure lives, and who be- lieve that women and girls may be
          reformed and trained into useful lives. All penal institutions should be re- formatory.
          Especially js this the case for women. Their sentence should be for reformation, and to
          accom- plish this long sentences are essential. This thought is now dawning upon the
          public mind, but may scarcely be said to have been formulated into an Idea.</p>
        <p>Prisoners should not be sentenced to "hard labor." It degrades labor, and gives a false
          idea not only to the prisoners, but to the public In regard to work. One of the greatest
          mistakes of our country Is the prevailing idea that labor Is degrading to woman, that to
          be en- gaged In the various departments of women's work is beneath the dignity oT a lady
          of culture. The poorer classes Imbibe the same spirit, ignore the various avenues open to
          them, and thus become an easy prey to vice.</p>
        <p>Very few women who are competent and willing to labor are to be found in prisons.
          Idleness and pride engender vice.</p>

        <p>In the conduct of a prison three elements are absolutely essential to be combined and
          actively and firmly enforced — industry, education, and religion.</p>
        <p>1. Systematized labor. What shall be the character of the industries carried on in our
          penal and reforma- tory institutions? The contract system in a women's prison or
          reformatory is out of the question, as it de- stroys or prevents all efforts being made
          for the refor- mation of the women, and hence would be in the long run a financial failure
          for the state. What kind of labor, then, may be taught in women's prisons and re-
          formatories which will aid in the reformation of the prisoners, be the most economical to
          the state, and least deleterious to the community? Prominent above all and most
          advantageous in every way are the duties of housewifery. She may and should be taught to
          do all kinds of housework. In the Indiana reformatory for women and girls, with which I
          was so long connected, every convict or inmate was required to work in the laundry for the
          first few months ill-health only exempt- ing. They were patiently taught to do their work
          well, and when that was attained they passed into an- other department, from one grade to
          another, like care in each being taken for their instruction, until at the expiration of a
          five years' sentence they went forth many of them well drilled in all kinds of
          housewifery, laundry work, chamber work, sewing, knitting, cook- ing, proper selection and
          care of materials, etc., with the means of an honest livelihood in their posses- sion and
          a kind of labor always in demand.</p>
        <p>Many kinds of trades may be taught if they do not involve congregated labor in the shops,
          for that kind of labor takes them back again into an atmosphere full of danger.</p>
        <p>2. The reformation of the prisoners being the prime object, anything that will promote
          that should be laid hold of. Education should have a prominent place. There should be in
          each department a school for instruc- tion, in which each convict should be required to
          spend a portion of time daily, the character of that instruc- tion to be such as would
          meet the needs. The minds of most women who get into prison are almost a blank, or, if
          furnished at all, they are furnished with rubbish. They do not think or reason. The mind
          should be in- structed and trained to purer thought, how to resist evil, and the higher
          and nobler purposes of woman should be developed and strengthened.</p>
        <p>The last, but not the least, essential element as an important factor in the proper
          conduct of a reformatory, is religious teaching, the development of a reli- gious life,
          religious thought, and, as, a consequence, right living. All the means of grace should be
          pro- vided — chapel services. Sabbath schools, prayer meet- ings, good reading, and
          practical Christian women to administer to all their needs. There should be a good
          library, and free access to it.</p>
        <p>This Is a partial solution of the great problem, how to arrest this tide of crime among
          women. And if carried out a large per cent, of that vast number of women and girls who
          have been before our courts dur- ing the last year may be turned from their course of evil
          and led to upright lives, thus removing from the community a cancer which is destroying
          the vitals of our state.</p>

        <head>VII. Children of The Steeet : Dependent Girls of Tender Age for Whom Homes Should Be
          Provided (Written by request of the Editor of the Chicago Inter- Ocean, January 25,
          1886.)</head>
      </div>
      <div type="chapter">
        <p>Children of the street, or girls of the street, what can be done for them? 1. There are
          some dependent children of worthy parents, who, from various circum- stances, such as loss
          of property, sickness, death, etc., have been reduced to a state of dependence or are in a
          helpless and exposed position, and if some power does not intervene and care for and
          protect them, they will be almost certain to fall into the snare of the deyourer. The zeal
          and earnestness, the watchful care and large- heartedness of the Christian philanthropist,
          should be of such a character that these unfortunate girls should be cared for at once, by
          placing them tempora- rily either in an orphan asylum, half-orphan asylum, home for the
          friendless, or some such institutions, until they could be wisely placed in good
          Christian-lo^'ing homes, where they would be receiyed and cared for ten- derly, wisely,
          and loyingly, not for the amount of labor they might perform, or the money they might
          earn, but for loye of humanity. This class should neyer be placed in any institution that
          has any taint or is the receptacle of the necrlected. Neither should they haye the stigma
          of committal. The class thus alluded to is comparatively small. A very moderate increase
          in expenditure, perhaps about what has already been done, and not involving a large
          expenditure of money, may be neces- sary^, but a great increase in earnestness and
          liberality in searching them out and caring for them is called for. They should never be
          neglected until forced to become "children of the street."</p>
        <p>2. There is another class of young girls who may unhesitatingly be classed "Children of
          the Street." A large number of young girls, mere children, whose wak- ing hours are spent
          in the streets, alleys, or in dens seething with vice, impurity, and filth. When at home
          they breathe continually an atmosphere of impurity. They live in small quarters, parents
          and children, boys and girls all huddled together, one or both of their parents in many
          cases intemperate — all things in com- mon, and thus all sense of feminine delicacy is
          obliter- ated. Again, in many instances the parents' love and greed for gain causes them
          to expose their daughters by sending them on the streets as venders of apples, papers,
          matches, etc., or to beg of the passer-by, or from door to door, and often punishing them
          severely if not successful in begging, or still worse, to barter their vir- tue before
          they are old enough to know what purity or virtue is. This class of neglected children may
          be counted by the thousands. They have been conceived in sin and born in iniquity. They
          have received a ter- rible inheritance, and from present appearances they are cultivating
          that inheritance with an avidity which will insure successful results of crime and
          impurity.</p>
        <p>And yet there is another class nearer maturity who have already fallen into the hands of
          the procuress, or the vile monster who would satiate his lust upon inno- cent purity: for
          either one of this class of vile monsters I can not find words of sufficient strength and
          force to express my contempt. I would either banish such vil- lains to some lonely island
          far away from kith or kin, where thev might consume each other, or incarcerate them for
          life in a prison on the separate system. But their poor child victims, with life wrecked,
          hope blasted, command our deepest sympathy. There are two classes to be provided for,
          ranging in each from six to fourteen years. Their surroundings very similar and their con-
          ditions in many cases so nearly merging into each other that to undertake to separate them
          or classify them seems ofttime a distinction without a difference.</p>
        <p>What can be done with them? There are various opinions concerning the problem. A large
          class of very respectable people turn from these considerations with contempt. Another
          class of persons who are active, energetic, and philanthropic, who devote much time and
          thought to stay some kinds of evils, and meet some phases of distress, ignore entirely the
          thought that a "girl of the street " may be rehabilitated. and sneeringly respond to the
          suggestion that they may become pure women. This idea is a relic of the Dark Ages and not
          befittincr the licrht of the nineteenth century. And vet those persons represent a large
          class of very respectable people, who think the probabilities of success in this work of
          philanthropy in caring for the " children of the street " depend almost entirely upon the
          sex, and that a girl who has been victimized, or who has lived in the atmosphere of
          impurity and crime, or whose life is on the street, might just as well be handed over to
          Satan at once — that for her there is no hope.</p>
        <p>There is another class of philanthropists whose labors are untiring, who care for the
          boys and girls alike. They with their large-heartedness and zeal have, reached forth their
          hands into the great maelstrom of neglect, want, degradation, impurity, and vice, and have
          gath- ered them all into their loving arms, and sought to do them good ; but in their
          mistaken zeal some of them have failed in accomplishing their grand and noble purpose.
          Instead of keeping those untutored, undisciplined waifs in an institution where they would
          be disciplined and trained and new habits formed, and where they could have been studied
          and culled, they, after a short prepa- ration, have hurried them out into the country and
          scattered them almost broadcast in the homes and hearts of the farmers, each child more or
          less a germ of cor- ruption. Those people with whom they are placed know nothing of the
          habits of those children, of the vice and ways with which they are so familiar, have but
          little system in their households, and are unfamiliar with the discipline that is needed,
          and great harm is often done to those who receive them and the community in which they
          have been placed. What is to be done? How can they be cared for so as to insure virtue and
          become a strength to the Nation instead of corruptors. We answer unhesitatingly it is the
          duty of the State to provide State schools, to be supported by pub- lic funds, and to be
          controlled by a board of managers composed of conscientious, capable Christian women
          exclusively, to whose management and care the girls should be committed until attaining
          majority, with power to arrange, to adjust, to classify, or place in families under their
          surveillance. After the children have been so drilled, instructed, and trained as to give
          reasonable grounds to believe their lives, thoughts, and habits are changed, and correct
          ones established. To most thoroughly consen'e this purpose sought for, there should be a
          receiving; building to which all should be sent, there to remain a sufficient length of
          time to enable the officers to study the characteristics and de- termine to which class
          they should be assigned. In different localities there should be erected a number of
          plain, substantial' buildings, built with reference to the needs to be met. These should
          not contain more than a hundred girls, and would be far better if the family did not
          exceed fifty, as the more complete the individual- ization, the more thorough the success,
          all to be officered by women, and the whole system under one board.</p>
        <p>The children should be taught correct habits, purity of thought and action: they should
          be given a common- school education, and their minds trained to digest the right kind of
          food and to do the different kinds of housewifery. The discipline should be mild, but firm
          and full of love. With the right kind of training and conscientious officers much good
          results may be ex- pected. By this gradation, thus hastily sketched, much of the evil of
          promiscuous commingling of the classes, which in most institutions is cause of difficulty,
          may be avoided and a good work accomplished. A large num- ber of each class would be
          referred or made over, and each becomes a center of influence for good instead of
          evil.</p>

        <head>VIII. Some Account of Work for the Insane</head>
      </div>
      <div type="chapter">
        <p>On an occasion when I was called to the Hospital for the Insane, to look after one of
          whom I was very fond, I was forcibly impressed with the gross neglect of the patients, and
          the abuse by the attendants; also the absence of careful treatment or effort to restore
          the patient to a sound mind. I made a very careful exami- nation of the building and the
          places of confinement. They were too repulsive to relate.</p>
        <p>There was almost a total absence of employment for the inmates or anything to occupy them
          except a few whom it was thought could be trusted to perform the labor necessarv for the
          building;. There was also a total lack of reading matter. A friend of mind whose mind was
          somewhat impaired, though not sufficient to send her to an asylum, but who Dr. Rogers had
          the courage to refuse to retain and sent her home, said to me: "Mrs. Coffin, if you were
          forced away from your home and locked up in a ward in the Insane Asylum at Indianapolis,
          with nothing whatever to do, nothing to sit on but a wooden bench, with insane people
          howling and screaming all around you, how long would it be before you would go crazy?" I
          replied, "Not two weeks." Her remarks impressed me with the need of some vigorous measures
          being adopted for the relief and care of a large number of a class, the most to be pitied
          of any other.</p>

        <p>When I spoke to my dear husband about it and told, him that I was thinking of taking hold
          of the subject to see if something could not be done for the care and bettennent of the
          insane, not only that some improve- ments in comforts for them might be provided, and kind
          thoughtful nurses, but that there should be ample medi- cal attention brought into the
          service, physicians who should devote themselves to the individual study and the peculiar
          cause of each, the reply was most natural, " I beseech thee do not undertake anything
          more, we have all that we can do now " ; but, dear good husband as he has always been, he
          entered into It with great inter- est. I corresponded with a number of superintendents of
          hospitals for the insane in other States as to the improvements which were represented as
          being done m some of the hospitals under their care, as to what could be done to make
          these institutions more beneficial. From some of them I gained much valuable information.
          Some suggestions were reported and I was encouraged to press on ; but nowhere did I find
          any effort to place the insane woman under the care of women.</p>
        <p>About this period Dr. William B. Fletcher was ap- pointed Superintendent of the Hospital
          for the Insane at Indianapolis, Indiana, a man of advanced thought who entered upon his
          work with a determination to do all he could for this most unfortunate class, " the in-
          sane woman." In him we found a valuable helper, who with his noble wife took hold of the
          matter and in a few months made many changes. I enlisted the inter- est of Dr. Mary H.
          Thomas, a rare woman, a pioneer in every good work. She was among the earliest women
          physicians and had endured much obloquy and much opposition to her profession. With her
          aid and that of Sarah J. Smith, we undertook to get a woman physician who should have
          charge of the insane women at the Hospital for the Insane at Indianapolis. Dr. William B.
          Fletcher was very favorable to the action and said he believed if there were women
          physicians to care for the women and girls, a large per cent of them would never become
          insane. "Women were very sensitive to the exposure of the diseases incident to their sex,"
          he said, "and as a consequences their diffi- culties were allowed to go on until beyond
          remedy."</p>
        <p>We selected a woman physician of prudence and cour- age, who had endured much as she
          pursued her studies, and aftei^ward entered her practice. We presented our request before
          the Board of Officers with her diploma, backed by unusually strong recommendations, and
          the Board took the request under consideration. At their next meeting they required a
          recommendation from each member of the Board at the University of Michi- gan from which
          she was graduated. This was pro- cured. The Board had by this time heard that she had
          taken a post-graduate course in the University of Pennsylvania and required a
          recommendation from that Medical Board. This also was procured. Then they said, "Ladies,
          we would like to gratify you, but as you are not voters, we must be just to our
          constituents, and you must get a petition signed by the leading business men of
          Indianapolis." We secured this and reported. The next request, or rather demand, was a
          recommendation from the Gov- ernor. I went to the Governor with the request and was given
          an audience. With many complimentary remarks he said he had ah^eady promised the position
          to Dr. Mary Thomas of Richmond. This I knew was false. On reporting my lack of success,
          she wrote to the Governor, "I have never asked you for the position; my practice is large
          and I could not afford to take it. I am one of the three who are making an effort to pro-
          cure a woman physician to have charge of the poor un- fortunate creatures of my sex." Of
          course the only way out of his dilemma was to give us the recommenda- tion, which was
          taken with great speed to the Board in session, and it was compelled to employ a woman
          physician, but confined her on a small salary to two visits per week, and to board in the
          city, however, "the camel had its head in and it was not long before it drew its body
          after it."</p>
        <p>I came out of that contest a full-fledged woman suf- fragist. If a vote was necessary
          before I could suc- ceed in getting a woman physician to care for the help- less of my
          sex, I decided that I must have a vote. About this time the Legislature of Indiana passed
          a bill for the erection of three new hospitals for the insane, and the Governor of the
          State of Indiana commissioned my husband and myself as we were about to go abroad,
          Delegates from our Government to the "International Congress for the Protection of
          Childhood" to be held June 12, 1885, and to inspect the modern hospitals in England,
          Scotland, and France, the three countries that had made the greatest advance in the
          treatment of the insane. We accepted the commission. In France we obtained but few ideas
          that would be of much avail in our country. In England we were treated with the greatest
          courtesy and saw much to admire. From each hospital we received some new suggestions which
          might be of use to us. The "Cheadle Asylum " near Manchester, England, had adopted the
          Cottage System with only twenty to fifty in a building", and these made as near like homes
          as possible. The build- ings were scattered over the county, some by the sea- side, some
          in the interior. The patients were trans- ferred from one point to another for change of
          scene and air, some were in private families, and all of the patients were under the
          direct supervision of the Board.</p>
        <p>The patients spent much time out of doors, no bars or locks were visible, and attendants
          were prov'ided in large numbers, who mingled with them. There was noth- ing to denote
          their position or authority. Employment was given to each individual a portion of the
          time: birds, music and various kinds of crames. and a g-ood library was placed within the
          reach of all.</p>
        <p>In Scotland near Glasgow, we found the system in greatest perfection. Men were engaged in
          farming, using various needful utensils without harai. The women were employed in
          housekeping, sewing, needle- work, the care of flowers, birds, etc. There was no visible
          system of restraint. They were miarded by attendants, but the patients were unconscious of
          being guarded. The condition of each was studied and their needs sought to be met. We were
          delighted with what we learned both of methods and results, and when we returned to
          America ladened with suggestions and hope of refoiTii. Dr. Fletcher, his wife and daughter
          As^nes, came to Richmond to visit us and gathered from us al we could give them for the
          development of their work in the Hospital for the Insane at Indianapolis. We were all
          enthusiastic. Enthusiasm is absolutely essential for any reform. We needed this, for the
          work which laid before us was gigantic, but that noble man, Dr. Fletcher, was ready to
          stand back of us, and being the head of the Institution he had the power.</p>
        <p>At his request I went to the hospital to consult as to what could be done. In passing
          through the worst ward called "The Bloody Six," owing to the extreme conditions of those
          poor miserable creatures, I noticed some of them picking the walls with pins, and upon ex-
          amination found some of their figures quite artistic in form. I suggested for a good
          starting point that blackboards should be made in the walls and crayons furnished for
          their use. The result was remarkable. Many of them were interested, others were delighted
          and showed considerable talent. Of course the efforts of some were quite crude and others
          grotesque. But it furnished occupation, interest and amusement, and awakened thought. Mrs.
          Fletcher advertised in the papers for toys, particularly those that were old-fash- ioned;
          the thought was amusing at first. I procured a lot of toys, some of them out of date, from
          merchants who were liberal and much interested. I purchased four dozen dolls and a variety
          of goods to dress them. My directions were that they should be clothed so as to be dressed
          and undressed at the recipient's will. The work was to be done by the convalescents. This
          work afforded them great pleasure and beguiled many weary hours. When the dolls were taken
          into the ward to be given out, they brought great delight even to those who were thought
          to have little reasoning power. One of the patients whose mind was farthest gone, dressed
          and undressed her doll using all the material of a baby's wardrobe, and at night with its
          nightgown on she took it in bed with her, laid it close to her bosom, and called Mrs.
          Fletcher to see it nurse, showing that motherhood never dies as long as life lasts — a
          beautiful thought, and still a more beautiful manifesta- tion of it.</p>
        <p>For some of the old and feeble-minded patients, yarn and knitting needles were purchased
          at wholesale prices, and when the stockings were knitted they were sold and the profits
          given to them. They knit with gi'eat dili- gence. Meanwhile they were taken out walking
          and taught to gather leaves and dry them to decorate their rooms. For Christmas they
          decorated the rooms beau- tifully and prepared a motto to put over the doors, "She brings
          sunshine when she comes in," meaning Mrs. Fletcher, they said.</p>
        <p>A kindergarten was started later. The result was most happy. Instead of screaming and
          yelling to the distraction of the neighborhood. "he Bloody Six" was quiet and orderly, and
          when I went in they all vied with each other in showing me the room.</p>
        <p>At Christmas, Dr. Fletcher removed all the restraints and made a bonfire of them. The
          patients were al- lowed to witness the flames as they ascended from the pile as it was
          being consumed on the campus while they sang "Praise God from whom all blessings flow,"
          and as long as Dr. William Fletcher and his wife and daugh- ter Agnes remained at the
          Institution there was great improvement in the comfort of the patients. Mrs. Fletcher was
          a model officer; she entered upon the work as a Christian mother, keeping in touch with
          the pa- tients, seeking to do all that she could for their im- provement. I have visited
          many hospitals for the insane but never met her equal. I feel this acknowledgment is due
          her as I had the privilege of seeing her inner life and work as perhaps few others
          had.</p>
        <p>We succeeded in getting one of the new hospitals for the insane to be in some measure
          conducted on the Cottage plan, but I removed from the State before the completion of the
          project.</p>
        <p>It is most remarkable when I think of how difficult it is to educate the public mind to
          the need, as well as propriety, of women to care for their own sex who are helpless or
          insane.</p>
        <p>An eminent physician who was fully in harmony with the work, added his testimony to that
          of Dr. Fletcher, that he was fully satisfied in his own mind, that if women physicians
          were to have the care of women and girls there would be comparatively few women found in
          hospitals for the insane; that most of them were there from some disease peculiar to their
          sex, and their natural timidity and modesty prevented them from sub- mitting their case to
          men physicians, until they were past cure.</p>
        <p>It was but little that we succeeded in accomplishing. My husband and a few other men did
          all they could to aid us. Our mite helped to swell the current and may yet become the
          mighty river that will bring bless- ing and comfort to many women.</p>
        <p>After our removal to Chicago we became much in- terested in The Cook County Hospital for
          the Insane.</p>

      <div type="chapter">
        <p>In 188-i we removed to Chicago and found a most interesting field of work. Shortly after
          our arrival two ladies, members of the Women's Club which had been organized several years
          before as a literary club, called to ask me to attend a club meeting and open the dis-
          cussion of a paper on Elizabeth Fry, giving some ac- count of her family and work, which I
          consented to do. I found an earnest body of ladies ennong; whom were physicians, lawyers,
          doctors, artists, and philanthro- pists. They elected me a member of the club. I entered a
          field of great interest to me and I tiTist of profit to them. They felt that the time had
          come to extend their efforts for the benefit of women and chil- dren. Men were then not
          expected to be present at the club meetings, but my husband freely worked with us outside.
          We had worked together as one in a large portion of our efforts for the benefit of
          mankind, so we now sought the opportunity for the continuance of our invited effort.</p>
        <p>In company with several noble women, Mrs. J. D. Harvey, Mrs. Sledel, Dr. Julia Holmes
          Smith, Dr. Hunt, Dr. Sarah Hackett Stephenson and others, to- gether with other women
          physicians, we visited the County Hospital for the Insane, and found it in a sad
          condition, the inmates herded together pro- miscuously, very few chairs for the feeble,
          the provisions for them to sit on being long benches built in and around the walls, or to
          sit upon the floors, and when they ate they crowded about with pieces of food in their
          hands. The table and the dishes were a dis- grace. There was but little chance for them to
          rest or to work. They had simply to exist. This was in 1886. A great interest was aroused
          for their better- ment and comfort.</p>
        <p>There appeared to be almost a total lack of attention or care for the restoration to a
          sound mind and healthy body. The importance of a woman physician to look after the poor
          diseased ones, helpless and hopeless, had been quite overlooked. The idea was if one was
          "crazy" she was done for; if she made an appeal "she was just crazy," if she told of
          horrible treatment, "Oh, she is crazy " — "we cannot put any reliance In anything she
          says" — and thus all were passing her by. We felt thoroughly in earnest to try w^hat we
          could do. By an earnest appeal to the Board of Commissioners we secured more windows,
          better ventilation, hundreds of chairs, some lounges for the very feeble, canary birds to
          sing, pictures, — simple though they were, — gave some cheer, made arrangements for the
          cultivation of flowers, furnished newspapers, collected books and mag- azines from our
          friends for a library to interest and occupy their minds, and finally the employment of a
          woman physician. They did not take to her. We were at a loss to account for that as the
          Principal was a sweet faced lovely woman thoroughly interested, and neatly dressed.</p>
        <p>The revelation came in a peculiar way. Dr. Florence Hunt invited some of the ladies to
          lunch with her one day and wore a very becoming black satin dress. True to her duties she
          passed through the wards. The inmates rushed around her in the greatest deHght exclaiming
          "Ain't she pretty, Oh, ain't she pretty? Won't you wear that all the time? We like you.
          Doctor." She promised if they would do as she told them she would wear it all the time,
          and faithful to her promise she humored them and her trouble ceased. When we visited the
          Institution they asked "Have you seen our pretty Doctor?" There came to us through this
          incident a revelation, the need of surrounding the insane with the beautiful. Experience
          shows that music is a great power in the restoration of the insane to a sound mind. Dr.
          Clouston of Morning- side Hospital for the Insane near Edinburgh, Scotland, has laid hold
          of and proved the value of this fact. The ladies of the Women's Club are still doing much
          for this hospital.</p>
        <p>We directed our attention to the Cook County In- firmary ; great need for improvement was
          found on every side. There were many who should be kept in employment, the larger portion
          were lounging around gossiping and quarreling and most of them were quite able and would
          be much better off and more comfortable with some employment.</p>
        <p>Owing to failing health I was obliged to retire from the work but not until women
          physicians for the female patients in the hospitals, and for the women in Cook County Poor
          House had been employed. The work is still progressing. The county is now interested and
          further efforts are being made to improve the system. It is now (1908) about to build a
          new improved infirmary.</p>

        <p>The Home Mission Association of Women of Indiana Yearly Meeting.</p>
        <p>After the great meeting held by the young Friends, during the session of Indiana Yearly
          Meeting in 1860, there sprang up in the minds of many a conyiction that a more thorough,
          active, aggressive work was needed. To accomplish this it was thought necessary to haye an
          organization free from Church trammels, one so formed as to be adjustable to the various
          needs.</p>
        <p>Women Friends were not accustomed to special or- ganized effort among the women, and in
          our church or- ganization there was but little for the younger portion of the members to
          participate in. The yoice of a woman in church action was rarely heard in expression of a
          personal opinion. The usual manner was "I unite" or "I am free," and never, I think I may
          say, to eyolye a system of organized work, which should bring out the energies of the
          younger portion of the members.</p>
        <p>Much life had sprung up, and many had received Christ and heard the command, "Let your
          light shine," but there was little opening. The women Friends were earnest, but timid,
          some of them frightened at their own voices and fearful to take hold and step out into a
          new field. Something must be done. The new life receiyed, the new zeal kindled would
          dwindle, and thus the Church and the world would be deprived of this vast amount of
          spiritual energy.</p>
        <p>An association had been started in England, led by Rebecca Thursfield, with whom I had
          corresponded for some time. This work, though small at that time, was the subject of the
          correspondence. John Henry Douglas and Murray Shipley, while on a religious visit to that
          country, had mingled in that work, and were ready to throw in their mite to strengthen the
          few women Friends on whom the Lord had laid the call for organizing in our field.</p>
        <p>These women were Harriet Steer, Sarah J. Smith, Mary J. Taylor, and Anna M. Pugh of
          Cincinnati; Elizabeth Hopkins, and myself. After much thought and prayer for guidance and
          wisdom, we finally de- cided that the "set time had come," and met for prayer and action
          at our house one morning during the Yearly Meeting of 1866. We invited Murray Shipley,
          Charles F. Coffin and John Henry Douglas to meet with us. A constitution and by-laws were
          drafted, the names of the officers were selected, and the names of Friends from all the
          quarterly meetings were selected to act as correspondents, whose duty it would be to
          organize in all the monthly meetings. It then became a question as to how to get the
          meeting called so that it would not be hampered by Church restrictions. We requested
          Elizabeth L. Comstock, who was a minister from Canada Yearly Meeting, to call, or appoint,
          a meeting for women to consider the subject, to which she agreed, the meeting to be in the
          large old meeting-house.</p>
        <p>Just as we were going into the meeting she said to me, "I am afraid to call the meeting
          without consult- ing the elders." I was much annoyed. Everything had been arranged for the
          meeting, and I knew that consultation would kill it.</p>

        <p>With an intense burning in my soul for the advance- ment of the work, and all absorbed in
          the purpose, and fearing that I was about to break the rules of the Church, I knelt down
          by one of the benches in the porch, and, taking an old envelope and a pencil wrote, "A
          meeting will be held this afternoon at 3 o'clock in this room for the purpose of
          organizing a Women's Home Mission Association of Friends. All are invited." As I was at
          the table as assistant clerk and the announce- ments were always read by me, I read it
          with the other announcements. We invited J. H. Douglas, Murray Shipley and C. F. Coffin to
          meet with us and give some information as to the needs of a constitution and by- laws. An
          executive committee and the name of a woman Friend from each quarterly meeting as cor-
          respondents were selected to have charge of the work by awakening a.n interest and as far
          as possible to or- ganize monthly meeting associations.</p>
        <p>We met at the time appointed and found seven hundred women assembled. Speakers had been
          selected to speak for the work. The association was organized by electing Rhoda M. Coffin
          for president, Sarah J. Smith, secretary, and Elizabeth Hopkins, treasurer, and
          correspondents were appointed as selected, the names of whom are to be found in the annual
          re- port.</p>
        <p>It was a meeting of much interest. A membership fee of $1 for annual membership, and life
          memberships of $25 was agreed upon. Mary J. Taylor, Anna M. Pugh, and Rhoda M. Coffin
          became life mem- bers — thus providing funds for the necessary expenses. It was a
          wonderful meeting. The women were ripe for the work and took hold with much Interest,
          joyful to have the opportunity to labor for Christ. Our men Friends present gave to us
          words of encouragement and experience.</p>
        <p>The work done the following year was remarkable: Cottage prayer meetings were held,
          Sunday Schools organized, jails, prisons and poor houses visited, tracts distributed, and
          meetings started.</p>
        <p>One woman Friend, as she thought of what she could do after she went home, took a horse
          and a little son riding behind her, carried a bag of tracts and started out on her
          mission. She found one school district where there was no Sunday School or place of
          worship. She went from house to house, giving tracts and talking with the people, and
          praying. She procured the use of the schoolhouse; others joined her in tract readings,
          cottage prayer meetings, and distributing Bibles. The people were delighted, and soon much
          interest was mani- fested. Gershum Purdue, an elder of advanced age, but full of love to
          his fellow men, was one of the faith- ful workers. Others, both ministers and elders, lent
          their help to the work, a protracted meeting was held, and a large number were converted
          and joined the Friends. A meeting was established.</p>
        <p>Work of a similar character, but not to so great ex- tent was done for six years
          throughout the various quar- terly meetings, all under the care of the Women's Home
          Mission Association. At the end of these years It was thought best to invite the men to
          participate, and the Yearly Meeting to adopt the work. The proposition was brought before
          the annual meeting for consider- ation. It at first met with considerable opposi-
          tion.</p>
        <p>Whilst the women were far behind the men in the commencement in practical united work,
          now they were far in front. The field had become so large and im- portant we felt it
          should receive the united energies of the Church. The men needed the revivifying influence
          of active mission work, and the Church needed it. After a time of prayer it was
          unanimously decided to invite the men to participate and the Church to assume the
          work.</p>
        <p>The following minute was forwarded to the men Friends, then in session:</p>
        <p>"The Home Mission Association of Women Friends of Indiana Yearly Meeting, which was
          organized by the women members in 1866, and has been zealously and efficiently prosecuted
          by them, resulting In the con- version of many to Christ and great benefit to the Church
          at large, and the field opening for successful labor, women Friends have decided that the
          time has fully come to Invite men Friends to co-operate."</p>
        <p>The proposition was joyfully responded to, and a large assembly met. We re-organized, and
          officers and an executive committee composed of men and women Friends from each of the
          quarterly meetings was chosen. I then resigned the presidency, which I had held from the
          beginning, as I had quite as much as I could do, and wished as soon as possible to take up
          another line of work, the needs of which had been developed during the years of active
          service. Levi Mills was appointed to the position, and was most efficient.</p>
        <p>The following minute was then forwarded to the yearly meeting in session Tenth month 7th,
          1873 :</p>
        <p>To Indiana Yearly Meeting :</p>
        <p>"The Home Mission Association, which was organ- ized by Women Friends in 1866, and has
          been so zealously and efficiently prosecuted by them, resulting in the conversion of many
          souls and great good to the Church, desires to inform the yearly meeting that the work has
          become so great and the field opening up for labor so extended that women Friends have
          thought it right to call upon men Friends for their assistance and support in the home
          mission work. In response to this call a new organization has been effected — officers and
          an executive committee chosen of men and women Friends from each of the quarterly
          meetings, who are now ready to prosecute the work. Believing as we do that in unity there
          is strength, and desiring the united sympathy and prayers of the entire body, we suggest
          to the Yearly Meeting that it recognize our association as one of the standing committees
          of the Yearly Meeting and that we report annually to the Yearly Meeting the result of our
          labors.</p>
        <p>"Levi Mills, "President of the Home Mission Association."</p>
        <p>The meeting agreed to the request and directed an annual report to the Yearly Meeting. Of
          the results and remarkable success in the many years of labor we are all familiar.</p>
        <p>Thinking it might be of interest to some of later years, who may wish to know something
          of the rise and organization of the Home Mission Association of Friends, as at first
          organized and put into operation, and being in possession of the facts I have written a
          short account showing the result of the first organized effort of women in Indiana Yearly
          Meeting for carry- ing out the teachings of Christ.</p>
        <p>Of the six women Friends on whom this work was laid, five have passed over and are
          receiving their re- ward, whilst their labor continues to follow.</p>
        <p>I have been permitted to remain and enjoy a fore- taste here. I know my race is nearly
          run, but, full of faith and love, I rest, knowing that I am safe in the arms of Jesus.</p>

      <div type="chapter">
        <p>I have been much interested in the article on "Foreign Missions," written by Mahala Jay,
          and have been led to think, that some information in regard to the first inception of the
          Foreign Mission Work and its beginnings, might not be out of place by one who was closely

          God in the unfolding of His will and leading therein, and the great result following by
          faithful obedience to the Lord's call, as illustrated by Rachel Metcalf of Eng- land,

          Purdie of Mexico, which has resulted in not only the establish- ment of Missions in India,
          Madagascar, and Mexico, which have been grandly successful, but the arousing of Friends
          everywhere from their apathy and the thor- ough awakening of a general and personal
          interest, as well as the formation of a Foreign Mission Associa- tion in all the Yearly
          Meetings of the Society of Friends, and the establishment of Mission stations in Syria,
          Palestine, Constantinople, Japan, China, Alaska, and Jamaica, besides a number of Stations
          in Europe and some in Africa.</p>
        <p>It was the privilege of my husband and myself to be brought into close connection with
          the movement in its earliest stage amongst Friends, hence I have thought that there might
          be those interested in some account antecedent to hers. In order to fully estimate and
          value the courage and faith of those noble pioneers, as well as those who came to their
          aid, it may be well to take a hasty survey of the condition of the Church, at that Hme,
          and the causes that led to the work. In the early history of the Society we find Friends,
          full of earnestness in the spread of the Truth, ready to suf- fer persecution and even
          death, that they might pro- mulgate the knowledge of God by preaching the Gos- pel. But
          after persecutions had ceased, the fiery zeal, which had been even to their enemies, sl
          cause for admiration, became almost extinct for more than a century. The Church turned its
          attention to building the walls around it to protect the fold within, rather than in
          obeying the command of Christ — "Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel to every
          creature." As a result, the Church became absorbed in itself, zeal- ously guarding its
          fold against ritualism and display, and everything that was thought to tend to fascinate
          the minds of its members or draw attention from the true source of Light. It unconsciously
          fell into an- other error. So strict and rigid were its rules, and bind- ing its forms,
          that individuality was lost, mental activ- ity suppressed, spiritual life and liberty
          curtailed. And that Church, which had been so full of mental activity, of spiritual life,
          of missionary zeal, of holy devotion to Christ, boldly marching to the stake in honor and
          de- fense of His cause, became unconsciously, and almost imperceptibly, a dead, formal
          body absorbed In itself. Darkness and feebleness settled upon it. Its power, once so
          strong, became paralyzed. True, there did arise here and there, persons who were filled
          with the Holy Ghost, who sought to convey the message of salvation to the unsaved, and in
          a measure to those without, by direct- ing the minds of their hearers to the need of
          salvation through the blood of Christ. In the midst of this gloom and dearth there were
          praying ones in the Church, praying for life, light, and liberty. God heard those prayers,
          and answered, and about the middle of this century, began moving upon the hearts of His
          people. To the honest seekers after Truth he revealed himself, and as they were able to
          bear it he brought them "out of darkness into the marvellous light and liberty of the
          Gospel." As they multiplied, and were obedient to God's call, they aroused others. In a
          quiet sort of way they moved, for the main body of the Church was not yet prepared for an
          active aggressive work. But the spirit of the Lord was at work. While He was preparing a
          heart here, and one there, to go forth with the message of glad tidings to heathen lands,
          He was also preparing the way. In 1860 He began to move upon the hearts of Friends, and
          there was a great awakening: in some of the Churches in America and Encrland. to more
          active service in their own midst. In I860 one lone woman, Rachel Metcalf, heard the call
          to heathen lands and prepared to answer "Here am I, send me." She yielded to the call for
          service In India amongst the women and children. She was a decided Friend, and wished to
          go as a Friend. She laid the subject, with her consecration, before her friends in
          England. The Lord had called her as a pioneer to lead the Church in that place. A few
          Friends be- fore whom she presented her mission had been prepared for the purpose by Him
          who has a right to rule and to whom we owe ser\dce. Feeling the magnitude of the work and
          faint hearted yet they dared not refuse help. A little band met and organized themselves
          into a "Provisional Committee," and pledged her support. This was the commencement of the
          work in India which has gi'own to such large proportions. The Lord pre- pared the worker's
          heart full of Christ's love, and clothed with His power. He prepared the hearts of those
          who had the means to aid her and made them willing to contribute for the prosecution of
          that service. He went before her and prepared the way, and the work has prospered and
          continues to expand. Its influence has been increasingly felt as time advances, and many
          are to-day rejoicing in Christ. And to Rachel Metcalf, led by the spirit of God to
          consecrate her life and go forth bearing the precious seed, courageously and faithfully
          doing the Master's will, is due the foundation of that great work, which has been, is, and
          will be, a great blessing to India as well as to England. All honor due her name.</p>
        <p>Simultaneously with this work of preparation for India the Lord had laid his hands on
          Louis Street and his wife, members of Indiana Yearly Meeting, U. S. A. for another work.
          For years Louis Street had felt he was called to labor in Madagascar as a Friend. In the
          winter of 1865-6 one evening he called on my hus- band and myself, and brought the matter
          to our at- tention, stated he knew nothing about how he was to go. He and his wife had
          prayed over it. They had two young children and saw not the way to leave, or to take them.
          He had consulted with two other friends and now felt the time had come for him to take
          some steps. In correspondence with our English Friends, we knew of the effort of a few
          Friends to aid Rachel Metcalf, and accordingly suggested that he should write to one of
          them to inquire of The London Mis- sionary Society if it would send him, he being a
          Friend. When the matter was fully brought before the Friends in England with the letters
          from Louis Street, and a letter of recommendation from a few Friends at Richmond, Ind.,
          they decided to invite him and his family to England in the latter part of the year 1866,
          that they might more easily open the way for them. They set sail for England 12 mo. 1st,
          1866, but were ship- wrecked the same night by a collision at sea and both vessels were
          lost, but the lives of all on board of both ships were saved. They were taken off the next
          day and brought back to New York ; however, the work to which they were called was not
          frustrated. The Lord had a great purpose in calling them out not only to bear the message
          of glad tidings to that dark land, but through their devotion, to arouse the attention of
          the whole Church to the needs in heathen lands, its duty and the part it should take in
          supplying that need. Un- daunted by the perils through which they had passed, and
          sustained by the promises of God and the abun- dance of His crrace, acnain they set sail
          12 mo. 8th, and after a stormy voyage landed in safety in Liverpool, where they were most
          cordially received by Friends. The Meeting for Sufferings in London took hold of the
          matter, became much interested, eventually appointed a large committee to aid in the
          development of the cause and to fit them out with supplies, etc. Everything seemed most
          propitious for the beginning of a Friends' Mission in Madagascar, under the care of London
          Yearly Meeting separate from other missions. But as the matter advanced it became evident
          that the Church was not prepared to go further in becoming responsible for the work. It
          was decided to not act officially, as a Church, and Friends withdrew from its official
          promo- tion, but not from financial support and interest. The subject was referred back to
          the Provisional Committee. Robert and Catherine Charleton of Bristol feeling it their duty
          to render efficient aid, entered heartily into sympathy with the subject, and with the
          parents in the exceedingly difficult problem as to what was the best disposition to make
          of the two dear little boys who were too young to leave, or to take, were finally led to
          the conclusion that it was their duty to take the children to their hearts and into their
          home and supply their needs while the parents went forth to labor for Christ in
          Madagascar. For twelve years most nobly and successfully did they perform this excellent
          service. The presence of Louis and Sarah Street in England, their sacrifice of everything
          for the privilege of labor- ing for their Lord in that dark field, that they might be the
          means of winning for Him many of those who were sitting in darkness, aroused a great deal
          of interest amongst Friends in England, who liberally furnished them with everything that
          was necessary for their sup- port, and many prayers followed them as they bade farewell to
          their dear children and sailed under the auspices of the Provisional Committee, from
          South- ampton, 3rd mo. 1, 1867, In the Cape Steamer for Mad- agascar. They arrived at
          Antananarivo, Madagascar, 6 mo. 1st, 186T. They were accompanied by Joseph S. Sewell, an
          English Friend and Minister, who, animated by their zeal and devotion, was led to join
          them In the work. These Friends became the founders of Friends' Madagascar Mission.
          Previous to this, there does not appear to have been any interest, or arrested thought
          towards Madagascar as a field for seiwice for Friends, and there is no reason to believe
          or suppose that there would have been a Mission founded under Friends' care, were it not
          for the ready response of Louis and Sarah Street to the call of the Lord, their faithful
          obedience, their entire consecration, and their willing sacrifice. For twelve years they
          labored most successfully. As pioneers they had much to endure, but they had the joy of
          remaining to see a great work established, which has continued with Increased, and still
          increasing force, until it has become a power amongst the people. Others have followed on
          taking up their labors. During the following summer after their departure for Madagas-
          car, the Provisional Committee in England resolved itself into a Friends' Foreign Mission
          Association. The work has expanded and grown, most liberally supported by Friends, but not
          yet embraced by London Yearly Meeting in its official capacity as its Church Work.</p>
        <p>As we have traced the providence in the lives of our dear friends, we have been almost
          lost In wonder as we have noted, how the little incidents of life, have been instrumental,
          in directing and influencing their lives, and the lives of others, but when we take into
          cogni- zance the indwelling Christ in their hearts, their con- secration of soul, we no
          longer wonder that all things are made subsei-v^ent to the mind and purpose of Christ, for
          the carrying out of His will in us, and by us, and through us.</p>
        <p>We have seen the effects wrought in England by the humble submission and response to the
          call of the Lord by our dear friends. Let us now retrace our steps to Richmond, Ind., and
          follow the influence vrrought on those left behind, and some of the results.</p>
        <p>.... Our dear friends Louis and Sarah T. Street had been one with us. They were members
          of Rich- mond Preparative Meeting; they had laboured with us in our large mission-school,
          and in all of our church work, and the aroma of their sacrifice was left behind, as a
          sweet savor of love to Christ. We felt its power, and that we had a part in the work ;
          when met together for worship, prayers always ascended for them, and as soon as they were
          settled in Antananarivo, collections by the women were taken up amongst Friends to aid
          Sarah T. Street in her work amongst the women and children, and for the supply of her
          personal needs. The mission-school in which they had been teachers, composed largely of
          poor children, entered with great spirit into the effort, and the first year contributed
          sixty-six dollars for that purpose. Friends had never been accustomed to giving largely
          for any purpose. The simplicity of their worship, their dress and manner of living, had a
          tendency rather to contract the mind and lead to self-absoi-ption, and the education of
          the Society up to liberal giving was a difficult and tedious process. But this must be
          done if the Church measured up to the requisition of our Lord to bear the Gospel to
          heathen lands. The mission of our friends was like a new light and opened up a new life
          amongst us. The letters from Louis Street and his wife were read with great interest, and
          whenever Friends were met together their mission and their letters became the absorbing
          theme. And soon the thought would pre- sent itself, is this an individual work only, or
          have we not as a Church a part to perform. It was like the leven hid in three measures of
          meal ; and as their letters, so full of missionary zeal and so vividly portraying the
          conditions in Madagascar, were read in different assemblies, collections were taken by the
          women from time to time, and ere long the Women's Indiana Yearly Meeting began making
          appropriations for Sarah Street. Then Friends followed, and for sev- eral years
          contributions were made to aid Friends in England to sustain their work in Madagascar. The
          amounts were small but the wedge had entered. In the 6th month, 1867, Francis W. Thomas
          and Charles F. Coffin, in conversation, decided to call a few friends to- gether for the
          pui'pose of organizing for work. A Friends' Foreign Mission Association was the result,
          composed of Francis W. Thomas, Charles F. Coffin, Joseph Cox, Levi Jessup, Micajah C.
          Binford, ^Murray Shipley. Harriet Steer, Rhoda M. Coffin, Elizabeth B. Hopkins, Mary J.
          Taylor, Charlotte Davis, and Hannah M. Johnson, with an annual membership fee of one dol-
          lar, and life membership of twenty-five dollars. Mary J. Taylor, C. F. Coffin, Murray
          Shipley, and R. M. Coffin became life members, thus forming the basis of a missionary
          fund; Murray Shipley was Secretary. Our first year was largely spent in familiarizing
          ourselves with the work of other missionary societies, procuring all possible information,
          correspondence with our friends, making small collections and talking up the subject. On
          10th mo. 3rd, 1868, we held our first public meeting, in which was manifested a good deal
          of interest, new members added, collections taken up, — for this was a most important
          matter ; for no people will sustain a continued interest in a subject without giving
          pecuniary support. Correspondents were appointed in all the Quarterly Meetings to organize
          auxiliaries, and awaken an interest in foreign missions, collect funds, and overcome
          prejudices against paying missionaries. The people were to be educated up to the
          obligation resting on them towards the heathen lands. The mission of assisting English
          Friends in the support of the Madagascar Mission and the supplying of Sarah T. Street with
          personal funds was continued and prose- cuted with increasing effort. Very soon we began
          to receive applications from Friends to go as missionaries to different countries. It was
          all of the Lord, all useful to us, widening our views, giving us a broader compre- hension
          of our needs, more faith that we were rightly called, more material with which to interest
          others, and preparing us for the work which the Lord had in prep- aration for us ; and
          thus we labored, cultivating a mis- sionary interest, developing the spirit of giving,
          until the winter 1870-71. Our services not appearing longer greatly needed to aid our
          English Friends, we felt that the time had fully come when we should look towards
          establishing a mission under our own care which we fondly hoped might ultimately be
          .adopted by Indiana Yearly ^Meeting as its work. It required no little faith, for our
          funds were small, and nothincp certain to be relied upon. During the first year our
          friends Elkanah and Irene Beard, who had joined us, felt called to India, and left us for
          that field in 1870, under the Friends' Foreign Mission Association of England. Much
          interest was awakened for them, and collections to aid Irene Beard were taken up and
          forwarded to her. At our winter meetincr we instructed our secretary to put a notice in
          the "Friends' Review," asking any called to foreign mission serv'ice to correspond with
          him. This brought response from seyeral Friends, amongst them our friend Samuel A. Purdie.
          who was then liying- in North Carolina, stating that he had felt called to deyote his life
          as a missionary in ^Mexico, and references were given. All the responses to the inquiries
          made were satisfactory. A correspondence was opened which continued for months. We had no
          mission. Our couracre almost failed : where would the funds come from.^ He had no
          experience, neither we. We pre- sented the Freedman, the Indians, the foreign fields under
          the care of our English Friends, but to all this he responded, "My call is to Mexico." We
          prayed for guidance and light. It came in a letter received from him, narrating his call,
          the efforts he had taken to prepare himself by studying the Spanish language, and engaging
          in work of a missionary character. We inyited him to meet us at our house in Richmond, in
          the latter part of the 9th mo., 1871. All the members of our board were present, with two
          younger Friends who had jomed it — Timothy Harrison and Charles H. Coffin. After a season
          of earnest prayer, and a thorough examination as to his call, the grounds of his faith and
          his ability to clearly present the Gospel, we became fully satisfied that the time had
          come to "launch out" and start a mission in Mexico. He was engaged and sent out, and in
          two months was on his way to Mexico. Of his call and of his entrance upon the work, I will
          let him speak by introducing a letter lately received from him in response to inquiries
          made:</p>
        <p>"From my earliest childhood the maps of Mexico, Central and South America had to me an
          attraction not possessed by any others. Among my childhood visions of fancy, S. A. Purdie
          was to be the Stephen Grellet of Spanish America. I would plan in fancy voyages on the
          Orinoco and Amazon, and among the Andes, and through Central America, and in the land of
          the Montezumas. A genuine Spanish-American preacher as a travelling companion, the fruit
          of my labors was the expectation which filled my mind with satisfaction. In the fall of
          1870, having just returned from New York with an invalid wife, and with the hope that her
          own native climate and the light care of a home only as wife of a teacher would improve
          her health, whilst a vast field of ministerial labor opening there before me would require
          my attention, a sudden, unlooked-for impression of a call to work in Spanish America
          entered my mind. A week or two later it seemed clear that it was no passing thought, but a
          "leading of the Spirit." I sent seventy-five cents to D. Appleton &amp; Co. for a Spanish
          grammar, about the end of September of the year 1870. I call attention to the date, for
          just one year later I was at your house in Richmond and received the approval of the
          Foreign Mission Committee for the work. About April, 1871, Murray Shipley had a notice in
          the "Friends' Review," asking any called to foreign mission service to correspond with
          him. I had previously had some correspondence with Thos. Williams, of Hunts- ville, Texas,
          and thought of teaching the colored school there whilst journeying toward North-eastern
          Mexico, toward which my thoughts principally directed them- selves ; but the notice of
          Murray Shipley led to my opening correspondence with the Foreign Mission Com- mittee and
          to come as their missionary. Whilst at Richmond, John D. Miles, after I was appointed,
          laid before the Yearly Meeting the appeal of Mexicans to Friends to send them
          missionaries. I wrote, prior to meeting with the committee, to Jos. Holdrich, the Secre-
          tary of the American Bible Society asking as to open fields in Mexico, and he specially
          recommended Vic- toria, !Mex. All the missionaries in Mexico at once accorded Tamaulipas
          as a Friends' mission field. Thus I hastily sketch down the steps leading me to Mexico.
          About February, 1871, I first met Juan Leon, at the Port's Mine, three miles from our
          home, and with him conversed in Spanish leaving him a Christian con- vert, with my Bible
          to study. He subsequently married a young lady who professed religion in a revival which
          preceded a few weeks my attendance at Indiana Yearly ^Meeting in 1871. We have now a six
          months' meeting composed of five monthly meetings, and have four native recorded
          ministers, four unrecorded, and many other native workers."</p>

        <p>Samuel Purdee landed at Matamoras in the latter part of the year, and essayed to go on,
          as we see his mind had been towards Victoria, but the Spirit hin- dered, and in response
          to what he believed to be God's guidance he commenced, with his feeble wife alone his
          helper, to found the Mexican Mission under the most ad- verse circumstances, with an
          inexperienced church at his back only partially awake to its duty, without experi- ence
          himself, with but little funds with which to carry on his misson, few would have had the
          courage to per- severe. His wife, fully in sympathy with him, joined him in the work. She
          started a school for the children, a movement which has resulted in the establishment of a
          girls' school at Matamoras. They deprived them- selves of the necessaries of life and
          lived in the most frugal manner. The Lord had gone before and pre- pared the way, and they
          seemed to scarcely have sown the seed until the harvest was ready for the reaper. They
          taught a day-school and a Bible-school. They started a meeting, begged a printing-press,
          did the printing largely themselves, and soon began to throw broadcast Spanish literature
          of a religious character, portions of the Bible, etc.; all of which was eagerly read, and
          tended largely to disseminate the truth as be- lieved by us. They passed through riots,
          scourges of yellow fever, small-pox, earthquakes, and storms, never complaining. The funds
          were slow coming in, and had it not been for the younger members of our association,
          Timothy Harrison and Charles H. Coffin, who were younger and more energetic, who sent
          hundreds of letters, to England and throughout our own land, seeking to awaken an interest
          and securing funds, and who ofttimes when there was no money in the treas- ury suppHed it
          themselves out of their own means, our mission must have come to an end. The story became
          an old one. Friends grew weary of continuous giving. They had not become accustomed to it,
          but the interest increased in the work at Matamoras. Very soon a little church was
          gathered of converts to Christ ; men and women of intelligence embraced the truth and
          desired to become Friends. A form of church government, a concise discipline fitted to
          their conditions and sur- roundings together with a basis of Christian faith, was prepared
          and sent to Samuel A. Purdie, and a church was organized. Elders and overseers were
          appointed, ministers who had given evidence of their call were recorded, and the church
          multiplied, and other stations were formed, school-books prepared and printed, other books
          translated into Spanish and issued from their press. The Lord abundantly blessed their
          labors and the mission, and the pressure to sustain it was a great blessing to the church
          at home. During the summer of 1873 we gladly accepted the services of our young Friends,
          Micajah M. Binford and his wife, who were most acceptable to Samuel A. Purdie, and
          rendered efficient service in the publishing department, teacliing, and conducting the
          church work, etc. But it soon became evident that his wife could not endure the climate
          and they were forced to return. In 18T-i we felt that the church was prepared to take hold
          of the mission as a church work. The mission was fairly organized, with a day-school, a
          Bible-school, a printing-press, and a meeting organized of seventeen members. A
          proposition was prepared and forwarded to our Yearly Meeting, which resulted in its
          adoption, as shown by the following minute, 10th month, 6, 1874:</p>
        <p>"The subject of foreign missions was presented by reading the Third Annual Report of the
          Friends' For- eign Association, and the response was as follows:</p>
        <p>"The proposition that this meeting should adopt the work of the Association was
          considered, and in view of the duty of the church to go into all the world and preach the
          Gospel to every creature, it was the judgment of the meeting it would be right to accept
          the proposition. The Friends named in the report are appointed a committee on foreign
          missions, and also the correspondents in the quarterly meetings, and are directed to
          continue to give attention to that in- teresting work, and report to next Yearly Meeting.
          Our subordinate meetings and members are desired to contribute liberally to the support of
          the work, and forward the funds to Charles H. Coffin, treasurer of the committee."</p>
        <p>This was a source of great rejoicing to the commit- tee. Our position was now changed.
          Indiana Yearly Meeting had accepted the mission and assumed the re- sponsibility, and we
          took our place as a committee under the supervision and guidance of the church. As we
          review the work we see the hand of God in it all.</p>

        <head>XII. The Results of General Grant's Indian Policy as Shown by the Work or the Society of
          Friends Among the Indians.</head>
        <p>Read at a meeting to consider the Indian Missionary Work, held in Chicago, 7th month,
          ^Qth, 1885.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="chapter">
        <p>At the first yearly meeting held at Richmond, Indi- ana, 10th month, 1821, the subject of
          the duty which Friends owed to the Indians was considered, haying been introduced by a
          communication from Ohio Yearly Meeting of Friends asking its co-operation in the work. The
          subject was referred to a special committee, which reported as follows : "Having met,
          after a time of de- liberation and a free interchange of sentiment, we united agree to
          report that the subject, under the present aspect of things is too interesting to be suf-
          fered to fall to the ground. We therefore propose that a committee of men and women
          Friends be appointed to co-operate with Friends of Ohio and Baltimore Yearly Meetings in
          carrying the plan into effect which has been proposed by Ohio Yearly Meeting, but that our
          committee thus appointed haye no power to make requisitions of a pecuniary nature on the
          members of this Yearly Meeting." By these minutes it appears that Ohio and Baltimore
          Yearly ^Meeting had been preyiously engaged in some work for the Indians among the
          Shawnees at Wapakoneta, and that Indiana Yearly Meeting, thus early in its infancy
          commenced a work in which it has labored untiringly for sixty-four years. Its efforts may
          not always have been the most wisely directed but nevertheless faithfully and earnestly
          per- formed has been the labor.</p>
        <p>The civilization of the Indians seems to have been the prime object. To effect this,
          schools were estab- lished by Friends sent out to live with them, a farm whs secured and
          great efforts put forth to give them a com- mon school education, and teach them how to
          cultivate the soil.</p>
        <p>For many years the results were small. The Shaw- nee Nation occupied their attention for
          fifty years with varjang success. A Friends' Meeting was held, a family of Friends
          residing on the farm and caring for the chil- dren and looking after their education as
          best they could until 1870, when we learned from the report to Indiana Yearly Meeting the
          whole affair had dwindled down so low that the government sold their lands and
          dispossessed them. Their efforts up to this time seem to have been almost futile.</p>
        <p>About this period, General Grant, the greatest mili- tary leader in our country, was
          elected President of the United States. The vexed question. What shall be done with the
          Indians.? m.et him on the threshold of his administration. It was he who " conceived the
          thought of a course of National conduct toward the Indian race, marked by peace, honor,
          justice, and Christian kindness."</p>
        <p>To carry into execution his great plan of subduing and controlling those wild men by
          benevolence and jus- tice instead of the sword, he summoned the religious element of
          America to his aid. Friends, who had al- ways been in the front ranks in their earnest
          efforts and sympathy for the Indians ever since the time of William Penn's treaty with
          them, responded to the call. The orthodox Friends on the continent of America are divided
          into ten bodies, or "Yearly Meetings," united together by correspondence. Each of these
          bodies, or "Yearly Meetings," appointed committees which re- sulted in the union of all,
          and the formation of the "As- sociated Executive Committee of Friends on Indian
          Affairs."</p>
        <p>According to the original plan of the President, Friends nominated the agents, who, as
          they were ap- proved by the government, were appointed to the differ- ent stations. Thirty
          thousand Indians were assigned this body of Associated Friends, consisting of the fol-
          lowing tribes and parts of tribes, viz. : Kiowas, Caman- ches, Cheyyennes, Arapahoes,
          Senecas, Kaws, Osages, Wyandottes, Ottawas, Pottawatomies, Shawnees, Qua- paws. Sacs and
          Fox, lowas, Modocs, Tonkawas, Mexi- can Kickapoos, and some of the Cherokees. To look
          after the interests of those tribes and parts of tribes in- cluded in the assignments, to
          civilize them, and seek to make them, not only good citizens, producers instead of
          absorbing, self-supporters instead of paupers on the government, but Christian men and
          women, imbibing the benign influence of the Gospel and showing ,forth the spirit of a
          Christ life among their neighboring tribes as well as among the low class of whites who
          were con- tinually annoying them, and also to show to the world the possibilities of the
          Indian becoming a law-abiding citizen, was the mission assigned to Friends. Agents were
          nominated known to be in sympathy.</p>
        <p>Schools were established among the different tribes, missionaries sent out, not only to
          teach them In school education, but to go from tent to tent, and from tribe to tribe and
          tell them of the glad tidings of salvation through Christ Jesus ; to hold public meetings
          among them, and in every way possible to open their minds to the fact that Christ came to
          save the Indian as well as the white man. Others directed their efforts teaching them
          manual labor — to plow, to sow, to plant, to reap, and to gather into their garners the
          fruit of their toil. This was difficult to effect, as the men had always looked upon labor
          as degrading to men, and fit only for women and children. But by the example of those
          noble men who hesitated not with their own hands to work, and thus dignify labor in the
          eyes of those for whom they were tolling, much has been achieved. This was an important
          point to be gained, for the work of reformation with any class of people can not be
          effected without Industry To supplant the love of the chase with a love of systematic
          labor and a pride In the result, was the Herculean task which has been accomplished with
          marvelous results.</p>
        <p>While one class of missionaries were thus engaged others were seeking to expand the mind
          and enlighten the understanding. Children were gathered Into schools and taught, revealing
          a fact hitherto disbelieved, their remarkable susceptibility to receive Instruction. Eager
          to learn, men and women came forward to take their places as scholars. The work of
          education has progressed, increasing In interest. There are now six governmental
          boarding-schools, one industrial training- school, besides a number of day schools under
          the care and direction of said "Associated Committee" [1885]. Two young women and one
          young man (natives) are now employed as teachers. The Osages and Kaws have established an
          order requiring all children from seven to fourteen years of age to be kept in school
          eight months in the year, or forfeit their share of tribal annu- ities. Seven hundred
          pupils have attended these schools the past year, and one hundred of them have professed
          faith in Christ. A pretty good showing.</p>
        <p>The third branch of their work among the tribes was the spiritual. Men and women were
          found who, count- ing not their lives dear, left their homes and friends, and under the
          auspices of the association commenced the greatest and most important part of the service
          — the revelation of the love of God in Christ Jesus. The Indians, with their original
          belief in the "Good Spirit," were willing to listen to the Gospel, and gradually the
          Spirit's work began to be manifested in their ranks. Children were sent to the Sabbath
          schools: the stolid indifference of the chief men of the tribe gave way to strong
          convictions; strong men bowed before the Lord in intense wrestling for His pardon; proud
          chiefs, hum- bled before the Lord, rejoiced in pardoning love: weary, heavy-laden, toiling
          women laid their burdens down at the feet of a complete Savior: young men, proud in the
          strength of their young manhood, yielded themselves to the cleansing power of the blood of
          Christ; little children heard and received and entered into joy: young women joined the
          ranks of the children of God. An abundant harvest appeared.</p>
        <p>The plowing of the native soil by the gospel plow, the faithful sowing of the seed of the
          kingdom, mingled with tears, and a holy life has been blessed by the Great Husbandman. The
          songs of the war dance have given place to the songs of Zion, the scalping-knife to the
          sword of the Spirit. Their gospel quivers filled with arrows of divine love, are being
          sent forth as messen- gers of blessings. Hundreds of the Indians have been converted to
          God, laid aside the panoply of war, and clothed with Christ's righteousness have girded on
          the weapons of his warfare, and are now engaged in active battle against sin.</p>
        <p>Churches have been organized in different parts of the territory, officered and conducted
          by Indian men and women. Several ministers of the gospel have been called of God and set
          apart by the church to preach the gospel. Marriages are solemnized in the churches, ac-
          cording to the order of Friends. Bible schools are held where old and young congregate to
          hear the words of life and to learn of God's law. House-to-house visita- tion, performed
          by native men and women who them- selves have been saved. Temperance societies have been
          organized, and among some of the nations are found their most earnest and able advocates.
          What has wrought this great change among those wild men of the forest?</p>
        <p>A union of three forces — industry, education, and religion — have combined under God's
          blessing, and have caused that great desert in God's creation to become a fruitful field.
          The blanket has been exchanged for the civilized dress, the chase has given way to settled
          homes, and now may be seen broad acres of well-tilled soil, good farm-houses, pretty well
          kept, the family all sitting at table, and the woman in the place of honor as the
          acknowledged mother of the house, and the father ministering before the Lord in their
          family devo- tions, and the children under family regulation and discipline, affording a
          wonderful illustration of the power of the gospel of peace.</p>
        <p>The most remarkable and successful work is that wrought among the ^lodocs, a strong,
          bloodthirsty tribe, full of deceit and cunning, fortified in the strong fastnesses of the
          Rocky Mountains. Thev resisted the United States Government successfully, while many of
          our soldiers and officers lost their lives in trvino- to subdue them, but without avail,
          until forced to sur- render by failure. They were assigned to Friends, and placed under
          the immediate care of two of the most successful of their missionaries, Asa and Emeline
          Tut- tle. On first removal many of them died, but soon un- der the loving ministrations of
          that devoted couple they began to yield to God, and the work of grace con- tinued until
          nearly every member of the tribe has been converted to God. Havino; become convinced of
          the peaceable nature of Christ's kingdom as accepted and believed in by Friends, they made
          public profession of their faith by joining that body, and have become strong advocates of
          peace and exemplify it in their daily lives, a striking illustration of which may be given
          in an incident which occurred a short time since. One of their young men was killed by a
          low, unprincipled white man on the border. It was a most provoking murder, without cause.
          The young men began to paint and prepare for revenge, when " Steamboat Frank," a Friend
          and a minister of the gospel of great power, hearing of their purpose, sent for them and
          said: " Brethren, we are soldiers of the cross and therefore can not fight; leave it to
          God who will avenge." The effect was magical. They dispersed to their own homes, taking no
          further steps to revenge their brother's blood.<note n="26">
            <p>The story of the Modoc Indians is an interesting bit of history.</p>
            <p>It was a tribe, not numerous — about 300 — that inhabited a stronghold in the lava
              beds of the northern mountainous regions of California, roving about and committing
              atrocities upon the white settlers, and were a constant menace to life and property.
              They were thoroughly wild, crafty and barbarous.</p>
            <p>Finally in 1872, the United States Government, to put an end to the friction they
              caused, laid a firm hand upon them. For many months the Federal soldiers were
              powerless to quell their murderous raids, the Indians secreting themselves in the
              impass- able niches and caves of the lava beds. In 1873, under command of General E.
              R. Canby, a United States OflBcer of distinction, they were surrounded by troops and
              through starvation were dislodged. While engaged in making terms with them under a
              flag of truce, Captain Jack the ringleader, shot and killed Gen- eral Canby and Dr.
              Thomas. This act, as a matter of course, greatly enraged the Federal troops and many
              of the Modocs were killed on the spot. Captain Jack was hanged. The tribe was
              afterward removed entirely away from their old haunts to the Quapaw Indian Reservation
              in the Indian Territory, where Friends established a mission among them with the
              results as stated by Mrs. Coffin.</p>
            <p>One of the most interesting school exhibits in the Educational Department of the
              World's Fair in Chicago, 1893, was the ad- vance in education and perfect school work
              by these Modoc In- dians and their children. M. C. J.</p></note></p>
        <p>To all of the above tribes and parts of tribes have the labors of Friends been extended
          and the gospel has been preached, and the educational and industrial influence exerted to
          a greater or less extent. There are now fifty-four Friends as missionaries ena-ased in
          carrying on this work. And this has been accomplished as the great result of that grand
          scheme which emanated from the noble mind and heart of General Grant, to whom our country
          owes so much, and whom all nations are now honoring: who, in the midst of his triumphs at
          the height of honor and position, with all nations loud in his praise, found time to turn
          aside from that glory and stoop to lift up the most degraded of his subjects, and throw
          around them the hallowed influences of the gospel of Christ, whereby they might have the
          oppor- tunity of being lifted up to equal dignity and honor God, "and joint heirs of
          Christ."</p>
        <p>It is not ours to speak of the heroism of General Grant on the field of battle, nor of
          his success as a military general, nor even his magnanimous conduct toward the conquered,
          but to hold up prominently be- fore the world as the crownlno- act of his OTeat life and
          the one to which Christians and philanthropists will alike point with gratitude and pride,
          this grand conception of tlie correct and successful solution of the Indian question.
          During President Hayes' administration the power to nominate agents was withdrawn and
          politi- cians took their place, many of them Inimical and but few in sympathy with the
          work. This has greatly ham- pered the efforts, notwithstanding, the work is progress- ing
          with increased success. And the grandchildren of General Grant will live to see the
          Indians endowed with the Inalienable right of full citizenship as the result of their
          noble ancestor's grand scheme.</p>

        <head>XIII. Women of the Orient</head>
      </div>
      <div type="chapter">
        <p>The first thing tliat attracts the attention of a trav- eler, upon entering the Orient is
          the condition of the women. In Egypt their degradation is very great. Hundreds of women
          may be seen working on the canals, on the streets, digging the dirt with their hands, put-
          ting it in baskets and then bearing it away to the place set apart for it. Crowds of them
          may be seen sitting on the sides of the streets with but little clothing on them, and that
          so filthy, tattered and torn that it would be impossible to tell what had been the
          original texture, their babies rolling by their sides in the dust under the rays of a
          broiling sun, many of them having scarcely ever been washed, and the flies literally
          covering them^ The women of the better class all wear lamba's, very much resembling a
          sheet form, composed mostly of bright-colored silks, occasionally an elderly woman may be
          seen with a black one, but owing to the intense heat, these are not desirable. The lamba
          is thrown over the head, brought down low over the forehead, and fastened under the chin ;
          a girdle passing around the waist con- fines it in rather a graceful manner, leaving the
          anns and hands exposed, which are tattoed and covered with jewelry. A veil, mostly of
          black silk, is fastened just beneath the eyes, by a coil which extends down the fore- head
          securing the lamba and veil in their proper places.</p>
        <p>No Moslem woman or girl would dare to go out on the streets unveiled, or permit a man to
          see her face, as thev would be sure to receive a scourmno; by their husbands or fathers.
          The women are very ignorant, being treated by their husbands with far less kindness and
          attention than they would give their favorite dog.</p>
        <p>"The Moslem men are nervously afraid of having their wives and daughters taught to read
          or write," said a Mohammedan to one of the Missionaries who was urging him to permit his
          daughter be taught. "What ! teach a girl to read and write, why she will write let- ters,
          she will, I know, actually write letters." This was reason enough in his mind.</p>
        <p>They paint around their eyes, their lips, finger-nails, etc., with henna. They wear large
          rings in their cars and their noses, and on their fingers, and many brace- lets on their
          arms, and around their necks are mas- sive chains ; they wear short stockings and long red
          pointed shoes.</p>
        <p>Missionaries are doing a noble work in Egypt in the elevation of women, and a better day
          is dawning upon them. Miss Whalely has for several years been con- ducting a school for
          girls with great success.</p>
        <p>The Syrian women, or the women of Palestine, are but little better in position, but
          perhaps not so low in habits of life. The Jewish women wear white lamba's and veils of
          goods very similar to our printed lawns, through which they can see distinctly, but which
          obscure their faces from public gaze, and when seen on the street and by the wayside, in
          the groves, and by the tombs, they appear ghostlike, but rather picturesque than
          otherwise. They spend much of their time sitting or lounging in these places. Not having
          their qiinds cultivated, and a very naiTow range of thought, thev follow the example of
          the men and gossip ; a low type of filthy conversation occupies much of their time. When
          traveling through that land and observing the domestic life of the women one does not
          wonder that the Apostle wrote, advising "that the women be keep- ers at home." We thought
          if he were there now, he might with propriety issue a new epistle.</p>
        <p>They are all lazy, both men and women, and do as little work as possible, and yet what
          little is done, is done by the women. They are married very young, from ten to twelve
          years old, having been bartered away by their fathers, perhaps in infancy. As soon as
          their husbands tire of them, which is sure to be sooner or later, they are made to do the
          most degrading work. Hundreds of them may be seen gathering manure and carrying it to some
          vacant lot where they sit down on the ground, roll it in dirt, make it in cakes, dry it in
          the sun and then bear it home on their heads for fuel. Fuel is very scarce and these go
          out over the mountains gathering binish, tufts of grass, and whatever they can find. They
          may be seen coming over the mountains with large burdens on their heads, almost covered
          be- neath it, ragged and wretched, bearing scarcely any resemblance to a woman.</p>
        <p>The Bethlehem women are a grade higher; are more nearly white, wear a head-dress covered
          with coins, and a white thin veil thrown over it. Their headdress is usually an
          inheritance, descending from mother to daughter, and is higlily prized. The coins of which
          it is composed, all bear the same stamp, each row of the same size. It is considered a
          great disgrace to lose one of these and the loss irreparable, hence in the para- ble of
          the woman with the lost coin, her trepidation and diligence in her search, and her joy in
          finding it. Their dress, similar to the men's, is a jacket and wide skirt with a drawing
          string at the waist and closed at the bottom, with holes through which the feet pass ;
          these are clothed with the red pointed shoes. They are all very fond of jewelry and wear
          it whenever they can. It was very comical to see babies without any clothing, at most one
          loose slip, laden with jewelry.</p>
        <p>Education is doing much for them. Dr. Thomson, the author of the " Land and Book," who
          went to that country from Cincinnati, and who has done much for the people, told us that
          when he first went to Palestine between forty and fifty years ago, there was scarcely such
          a thing known as a woman or girl who knew her let- ters ; now the education of the girls
          has become almost a mania, the fathers pressing their daughters into the schools. As a
          money-making measure, when educated they bring a higher price for wives. They are sent to
          the Mission Schools under the care of our noble Mis- sionaries where every effort is made
          to bring them to a knowledge of Christ. They learn very readily, are very susceptible, and
          many of them are converted while in the school. They are taught to sew and something of
          our civilization, and many heartrendering instances oc- cur, when having tasted of better
          things, they are ruth- lessly torn away from those whom they have learned to love, and
          given over for a wife to a man, worse than a brute, who ofttimes, the first thing he does
          is to give her a good scourging "to break her of her foolishness," as he says. We saw some
          very touching instances of this kind, and yet down in the soul there still lingered faith
          in the Saviour they had learned to love, and hope as an anchor to the soul buoyed them
          up.</p>
        <p>Their dwelling's are built of stone, some eio:ht to twelve feet high, and covered with
          sticks and brush; over these earth is placed about a foot thick, and heavily rolled : this
          work is done by the women, and on a rainy night, you may see the lights the women carry as
          they moved about on the tops of the houses, stopping up the cracks lest their liecre lords
          should o-et a wettinf?. The houses, which vary in size from 6 by 8 feet and some as large
          as 10 by 20 feet, have no windows, a dirt floor on which the fire is built, without any
          way for the smoke to escape, excepting from the low door. They have usually an elevated
          platform on one side, on which the family sleep. Their bedding mats much resemble Persian
          rug's. On rising; in morning:, these are rolled up and set to one side. It was this kind
          of a bed which the man, when healed by Christ, at his command "took up, and walked." Their
          food is of the simplest kind, onU' one vessel in which it is cooked, then with spoons they
          gather around to eat ; the dishes are soon washed, and the house put in order. This is the
          condition of the women as we saw it while traveling: in that land.</p>

      <div type="chapter">
        <p>December 18, 1885. Sarah J. Smith, of world-wide fame and a great philanthropist, is no
          more. She quietly folded her arms and fell asleep in Christ at the residence of her
          daughter, Mrs. William J. Hiatt, at Dublin, Wayne County, Ind., on the morning of the
          17th, <note n="27">Mrs. Sarah J. Smith died December ITth, 1885.</note> after a grand and
          noble life of more than three- score years and ten, full of faith in her Redeemer, to
          enjoy the completion of her faith and the fruition of her hopes. She was one of the women
          of the age, one of those special characters brought forth for the ad- vancement of the
          Nation from one epoch to another. Vice-President Hendricks of Indiana, said in speaking of
          her remarkable powers : "God Almighty never made another Mrs. Smith" ; and Governor Conrad
          Baker, — now of sainted memory — a man of rare virtue, and, like Mr. Hendricks, a noble
          example of domestic purity and marital fidelity, and a great believer in women's ability
          and her advancement — said of Mrs. Smith, " She is the most wonderful woman of the age,
          prepared by God especially to lift up tlie fallen and lead women on to higher purposes and
          broader fields."</p>

        <p>Mrs. Smith was surpassed by none in the breadth of her philanthropy — her active
          benevolence, the scope of her charity, the strength of her integrity, the breadth and
          length, and depth, and height, of her love to God. The result was a life of self-sacrifice
          in her labors for the alleviation of the sorrows of human kind. Bom and reared in England,
          she received the benefits of the education and family training which is the chann of
          English homes, the cultivation of the love and study of nature in the animal, vegetable,
          mineral and floral kingdom, a training which so beautifies the English family life. She
          had a love for art, literature, and poetry, and a strong compassion for the suffering of
          the millions living on the lowest scale of human life. She dived into the lowest depths
          and brought up to clearer light many sparkling jewels.</p>
        <p>The recital of Elizabeth Fry's remarkable work for the prisoners in the London Bridewell,
          and on the English prison ships, left an impression on Sarah J. Smith's susceptible mind
          which was afterward the basis of the wonderful fruits of work of like character in her own
          life.</p>
        <p>When she arrived at the age of maturity she married James Smith, of Sheffield, and
          thither removed, and for years was devoutly engaged in the beautifying of her home, the
          happiness and interests of her husband, and the training of her children. Hers was a
          beautiful home life, presided over by a cultured. Christian woman. Because of declining
          health and unable to endure the climate they were forced to leave their native land and
          seek a home on western soil, coming to Amer- ica they settled near Milton, Wayne County,
          Ind., on a farm. This was a new experience, but she was quite equal to the situation. She
          brought into her new sphere not only the lovely example of a Christian home, but untirincr
          enercry and zeal for the comfort and advancement of others. She gave a strong impulse to
          the advanced education of children, and illustrated the possibility of a farmer's wife
          devoting some portion of each day to the cultivation of her own intellectual powers,
          thereby being fitted for the culture and training of her cliildren.</p>
        <p>She was deeply interested in the progress of educa- tion, in the establishment of Earlham
          College at Rich- mond, Ind., under the auspices of Friends, and in the development of the
          present school system of Indiana.</p>
        <p>She was a member of the Society of Friends — a Friend by conviction, converted to God
          through Jesus Clirist in childhood. She was early called to the ministry of the gospel.
          That call was recognized bv the church and for more than fifty years she faithfully
          preached the Word with great success throughout the United States, and in England, giving
          the powers of her life to the work of the church. She visited hospitals, and the prisons
          of this land as well as in her native land, err- incr women's homes, and all kinds of
          institutions where sorrow was found. She once visited all of the public institutions of
          benevolence in Chicago, also the county jail and Bridewell. While visiting the county jail
          she attempted to hold services with the women. Prayer had been offered by another lady.
          When ^Irs. Smith began to speak they thought to stop her by their noise and confusion. She
          ceased speaking, and kneeled in prayer. She was always most powerful in prayer, She seemed
          to grapple the throne of grace and to bring the hope of mercy. They were subdued, and for
          hours afterward she labored in the prison with great success. As she went about bearing
          aloft the torch of God's love and the hope of salvation, she sought to enlighten the homes
          of the poor and unfortunate by making them attractive with books, music, and pictures.</p>
        <p>Her attention was especially directed to young men, encouraging them, warning them,
          praying for them, and when they fell by the way and were in the hands of the law, she
          would herself go on their bonds, pay their fines, and thus show practically her interest
          in them. Hundreds now, as " brands from the burning are filling honorable, useful lives,
          and rise up and call her blessed.</p>
        <p>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, and the groans of the wounded went up as a great
          wail over our land, her warm and sympathizing heart responded to the call of distress.
          Although exceedingly delicate and feeble physically, full of faith in her Lord whom she
          believed had called her, she went forth accompany- ing her friend, <persName>Mrs.
            Elizabeth Comstock</persName>, who was a noted worker in field and hospital, for our
          brave soldiers. From fort to fort, and camp to camp, close in hearing of the roar of
          battle, ofttimes so near the engagement that bullets would pass all about them, they might
          be seen with lint and bandages and restoratives passing among the wounded and dying in the
          hospitals, minis- tering to the suffering, whispering words of comfort, and pointing them
          to Christ as " One mighty to save." Many most touching incidents Mrs. Smith would in after
          years relate from her storehouse of memory. She knew no difference in color or creed.
          Wherever she found sorrow she ministered to it. Her attention was directed to the large
          number of colored orphan children, made so by the war, and who, amid the strife, were
          dying by hundreds through neglect and starvation. She suc- ceeded in procuring the use of
          barracks near Helena, Ark., and was ultimately successful in securing a perma- nent grant
          of several hundred acres on which has been established a school, from which have gone
          forth hun- dreds of young colored men and women as teachers of their own race. This she
          placed under the care of Friends. Thus she labored, forgetful of self, until her health
          failed, and she and her faithful husband who was always by her side, returned home as she
          thought to die, — but God ordered otherwise.</p>
        <p>Scarcely was her health restored when there came a call of a different nature, one which
          proved the begin- nino; of the crownino; work of her life. As a result of the war homes
          were devastated — immorality, the accompaniment of war — increased fearfully, children
          were neglected, and it was felt that something must be done to save the bovs. She crave
          herself to this work with great enthusiasm, and went with a company of men and women of
          like spirit to the capital. There she labored until no one individual had greater in-
          fluence over the minds of leading men in the admin- istration of the moral government of
          the state. This work accomplished she was called to Indianapolis to aid in the
          organization of a work among her own sex who had departed from virtue. They closed her
          quiet home from which the children had all married and gone to homes of their own, and
          went as Mrs. Smith thought only for a short season, to begin an organized effort — the
          establishment of a Home for the Friendless in Indianapolis. Here she remained until called
          to take charge of the Woman's State Reformatory of which she had charge about nine years.
          To this work, which required so much courage, she was quite equal, coura- geous in times
          of danger and fearless under conviction of duty, she went down to the lower depths. She
          pene- trated into dark recesses and grappled alike the sin and licentiousness in both men
          or women. With quickness of perception, warmly Sympathetic, generous to a fault, she was
          just the one for the position.</p>
        <p>Passing on the street one day she heard the muffled cry of agony from a little child, and
          peeping through the keyhole she saw a little girl of six years of age in the hands of a
          man who was ravishing her; quick as thought with Herculean strength, she broke in the
          door, rescued the child, took her to the Home and cared for her, had the man prosecuted,
          and on her testimony he was convicted. While on the stand his attorneys tried to confuse
          her, but instead of confusing her she only took fresh courage, and turning to the jury she
          gave such a forcible testimony, appealing to them as fathers, that they gave a verdict
          before they had scarcely left their seats, which caused his conviction for twenty years in
          the State prison.</p>
        <p>A young girl came under her care to be nursed who at the age of thirteen years had been
          seduced by her employer, a leading public man of the State who was a great admirer of Mrs.
          Smith's ability. She first secured all the evidence of his guilt, which the girl had in
          her possession, and then sought an inter^'iew with the gentleman, laid the matter before
          him for counsel without revealino' the fact of her knowledge of his guilt. He entered into
          it with interest, and assured her of his assistance. When about to depart she said, "Thou
          Art the Man, and I will act as thou has sucr- gested." Of course neither of these men were
          admirers of Sarah J. Smith afterward. One is still in prison; the other should be.</p>
        <p>Some of her coadjutors with whom she worked for years in the same field of benevolence,
          having ascer- tained the fearful corruption existing in the JefFerson- ville State prison,
          in which the women criminals of Indiana were incarcerated, Mrs. Smith's whole nature was
          aroused to action and she was foremost in efforts to meet the demand for a reform. She
          never rested until a Women's and Girls' Reformatory was established at Indianapolis, and
          at the earnest request of the Gov- ernor of the State and the Board of Managers, she was
          induced to take charge of and start the Institution, hoping for some one to follow when
          the "coming woman" could be found. In the spring of 1869 the Reformatory was declared
          ready for the reception of the women of the JefFersonville State prison, the most
          hardened, debased, and undisciplined of women, scarcely a vestige of womanly instinct in
          them. As the carriages containing the prisoners drew up before the door, Mrs. Smith stood
          in the doorway- dressed in her Quaker costume, which she always wore, with snow-white cap
          and handkerchief, and with a fine physique and noble beauty, her handsome face, as she
          stood, feehng the responsibility of her position and the work before her, she was
          illuminated by a sacred light direct from the Holy Spirit under whose inspiration she was
          then act- ing. The first prisoner was brought in by four stal- wart officers manacled hand
          and foot. Under the reform- ing influence of the Institution, and Mrs. Smith's care, this
          woman has led for fourteen years a meek, humble, self-denying life. <note n="28"> he story
            of this prisoner is told in Mrs. Coffin's account of the "Origin of the Women's Prison
            and Girls' Reformatory" in Indiana. Page 149.</note></p>
        <p>This case is an illustration of Mrs. Smith's power over evil, of her government, and of
          her tact. For thirteen years she toiled, and suffered, and endured, counting nothing too
          dear to be given up for the ref- ormation of those coming under her care. Success- fully
          she solved the problem. Can women prisoners be re- formed, and How can it be done.^ Over
          80 per cent, of those who have been under her care are leading upright lives in their
          sphere. Her name and fame has gone abroad throughout the length and breadth of the civil-
          ized world. In the '* International Congress for the Protection of Childhood " held in
          Paris in 1883, when her name and work was mentioned, the whole congress rose to its feet
          spontaneously in reverence and recogni- tion of her work. The Rev. Dr. E. P. Wines, in his
          book on Prisons, speaks of her as a model prison offi- cer — " the best in the world."</p>
        <p>While her heart was all aglow with compassion for those under her care, she was firm in
          discipline and those who would not yield by the gentle ministration of love were obliged
          to yield by a more severe method. She did not pamper them, she only showed the beauty of
          holiness and the possibility before them, and gave them such discipline as would enable
          them to accom- plish it. They knew in her they had a friend and many of them loved her
          dearly. She had her weaknesses — all strong characters have — and no one was more con-
          scious of them than she, and if she were speaking to-day she would say, " Look not at the
          instrument, but away from me to Him throua:h whose o-race I am what I am." She had
          enemies. Some of them pursued her with a zeal worthy of a better cause. They called for an
          investigation. The gates of hell were opened against her ; the contest was headed by the
          man who had been the seducer, and a man of exceeding: licentious habits, and their
          witnesses were from houses of prostitution. She came forth clearly vindicated.</p>
        <p>Her husband who was much her senior, was her faith- ful support and wise counsellor.
          Failing in his health, she retired from the Institution to which she had given the best of
          her life, and faithfully nursed him until his death. The long strain of nursing, and the
          separa- tion from one to whom she had been so closely united, was too much for her
          sensitive nature. A decline was soon evident, and although so enfeebled, her interest in
          the Reformatory was unabated, and continued to the last. Her final illness was short. Full
          of faith in her Lord she took leave of earth and all its pleasures, and triumphantly went
          forth to meet the Lord.</p>
        <p>Thus I have sought to give a faithful portraiture of one of the most remarkable women the
          world has produced, a full, rounded character, filling with equal devotion her position as
          a wife, mother, friend, and benefactor. It seems fitting that such a life should thus be
          portrayed as an illustration of the powers of womanhood.</p>

        <p>As far back as is actually vouched for by Colonial records, the main root of the Johnson
          family began its growth in Virginia in the seven- teenth century. That the ancestral line
          of de- scent to which Mrs. Rhoda ]M. Coffin belonged, was among the very earliest
          colonists of the coun- ties of Xew Kent and Hemico, [163-4] on the James river, and
          Middlesex on the Rappahan- nock, in lower Virginia, and later scattered themselves over
          the part of the State, which be- came Hanover, Louisa, Amelia. Campbell and adjacent
          counties, the public and parish records make very clear. This, however, was not the origin

          families from Charleston and its vicinity, the Massies (Massey), Lynches, Camp- bells,

            consider John Fiske the most correct and reliable his- torian of our American colonial
            period than any other writer. In these pages I shall freely draw from his valuable work,
            " Old Virginia and Her Neighbors," in reference to conditions and points which touch our
            historical and genealogical narrative. — The Editor.</note> says: "The Scotch-Irish have
          played a much greater and more extensive part in American his- tory than has yet been
          recognized. There was hardly one of the thirteen colonies upon which these Scotch- Irish
          did not leave their mark.</p>
        <p>" From the earliest Immigration of the Scotch-Irish Into this upper country the
          development of the colony was not as In New England from many distinct settle- ments, but
          from one central point — the town of Charlestown." <note n="32"> "Hist, of Sotith Carolina

        <p>" In 1634 this Virginia colony was organized into counties and parishes. A few of the
          oldest counties arose from the spreading and thinning of single settle- ments. This was
          particularly the case in James City and Charles City Counties <note n="33">Fiske, Vol.

        <p>" The whole general complexion of South Caro- lina at this early period as regards
          religion and poli- tics was strongly Puritan. Perhaps one-fifth of the people may have
          belonged to the Church of England which was established by the Proprietary Charter and
          remained the State Church until 1776. The EngHsh parish with its church wardens and

        <p>The Vestry Book of St. Peter's parish shows that Robert EUyson [Ellison], John Johnson,
          William Johnson, and Thomas ]Massie, all ancestral forefathers of the generation to which
          Mrs. Coffin belonged, were vestrvestrymen and active in church affairs for a period
          covering a full half-century or more, and were unfailingly punc- tual at the vestry
          meetings; indeed, they were leading" fiorures in the colonv as evidenced bv the personal
          records.</p>
        <p>"The vestry in those times exercised the chief authority in the parish. It apportioned
          the par- ish taxes, appointed the church wardens, acted as overseers of the poor," <note
            n="36"> "Old Virginia and her neighbors," Vol. 2, p. 36.</note> and performed other
          special offices. The parish records show that the salaries, charities, and most of all the
          business of the parish was paid in tobacco.<note n="37"> "Parish Vestry Book of St.
            Peter's," 16882-1728, p. 36</note> At the vestry meeting, "August Y 24. 1751," Robert
          Ellyson and William Johnson were appointed a commit- tee to divide lands that belonged to
          the church into twenty precincts. John Johnson and Captain Massie received a like
          appointment for which service they were to be paid 1200 pounds of tobacco. <note n="38"
            >Ibid., p. 137.</note></p>

        <p>It is to be noted that the footprints of all these families are on the early records as
          slaveholders. The slaves belonging to them are registered by name in the parish books by
          the score. It is especially interesting to note records like the following:</p>
        <p>"Betty, a negro, belonging to Capt. Thomas Massie born August y® 15, 1728."</p>
        <p>"Jim, a slave of Captn. Thos. Massie born 1708." <note n="39"> "Parish register of St.
            Peter's." In 1696 the clergyman's salary was fixed by law at 16000 pounds of
            tobacco.</note></p>
        <p>In some instances the name of a child born to the master occurs the same year and is in
          the same list with the slave. During a period cover- ing much of the seventeenth and
          eighteenth cen- turies the Johnsons and their near kindred held slaves ; even after the
          families of another gener- ation had united with the Quakers there are "disownments" <note
            n="40">"Our Quaker Friends of Ye Olden Time" by J. F. Bell, p. 149.</note> on the
          Friends' records of lineal descendants who had scarcely given way to the "testimony" and
          rules which the Society had gradually but finally declared for the freedom and rights of
          the individual black man.</p>
        <p>There is nothing on record to evidence that these Ancestors had any extensive
          communication with the world, though their settlements lay on the beautiful James river,
          the York, and Rap- pahannock rivers, and were not distant from the Chesapeake Bay. It is
          not disclosed that they became notably worthy of fame. They were re- spected personalities
          in the church as the personal records make known. The general character of the colony was
          high and " stood for educating the white population, morality, and religion." The lives of
          the landholders were devoted much as were the lives of all Virginia planters of " Ye olden
          Time " to social, domestic ties, and to their plantations worked by their slaves. Tobacco
          was the great product and commodity for all commercial exchange. After the generations of
          those with whom the Quaker records make us acquainted, they were, with few exceptions,
          staunch and faithful Friends.</p>
        <p>The tide-water section of Virginia during the first century of its habitation by these
          early an- cestors was a heavily wooded ^^dlderness. The usual method of passing from one
          point to an- other was in open sloops and canoes on the creeks and rivers, and walking
          through the forests. At some seasons of the year they could journey through the bogs and
          swamps on horseback. In the month of February, 171-i, Thomas Wilson and James Dickinson,
          two Quakers, making for the Friends' Settlement, landed on the Rappa- hannock river and
          went ashore at Queen Anne's Town and passed over to York river, then " took our saddlebags
          and great coats on our shoulders and traveled afoot several miles." <note n="41">"Southern
            Quakers and Slavery," by Weeks, p. 79, 11 Ibid., p 80. </note></p>
        <p>The Indians had not yet moved onward toward the setting sun. The Quakers did some
          mission- ary work among them.</p>
        <p>The year the Johnson families became Quakers is not made clear. There were scattered
          unor- ganized meetings of the Friends in this part of Virginia at an early period — 1678.
          James Dick- inson — mentioned above — visited the York river country and Kent county in
          1691, and writes in his journal, "A meeting was settled from that time."</p>
        <p>One Joseph Newby, a Quaker evangelist, came from North Carolina into the settlement near
          the close of the century, or early in the eighteenth century, and like John the Baptist,
          lifted up his voice in the wilderness, disclosing a Deity in such fervor and power and
          with so much intensity of heart that a sweeping conviction reached the hearts of his
          hearers and convinced a large num- ber of the inhabitants that the spiritual standard,
          beliefs, and principles of the Quakers were right. It is stated through tradition that the
          larger pro- portion of the then sparse population became members with the Quakers, and
          were afterward the founders of the earliest organized Virginia meetings.</p>
        <p>So little is known of the personal history of the first John Johnson of whom we have
          record we cannot give exact dates concerning him. It is evident that he was born about the
          middle of the seventeenth century, but whether or not in Ulster or in the Charleston
          district of South Car- ohna, we cannot now say. He was a faithful and active member of the
          Established Episcopal Church in the Virginia colony.</p>
        <p>The tradition has been that the head of each successive generation in this particular
          line of descent we are now tracing was named Jolm Johnson.</p>
        <p>The authenticity of this tradition is not to be doubted, since it is borne out as far
          back as church and manuscript records give evidence. But it is not possible until further
          research is made, to unravel from the earliest docu- ments and records the compicated
          threads which definitely individualize the first progenitor by the name of John. In the
          parishes of New Kent and Middlesex Comities, there lived two men by the name, both of whom
          were born, as we have already stated, the middle of the seventeenth cen- tury. These men
          were evidently kinsmen in blood; the one "married Mary Broadbent, <note n="42"> "Parish
            register Christ Church," Middlesex, 1653-1812.</note> 22d November, 1680," the other "
          married Lucinda Blake, April 6, 1686." We have, at this date, no further record of their
          parents.</p>
        <p>We conclude that the genealogical line we are now tracing is lineally descended from the
          sec- ond of the two — John and Lucinda [Blake] Johnson. <note n="43"> 16 It is a tradition
            in the family that an early ancestor, John Johnson, married Elizabeth Massie whose
            mother was an Ashley of the South Carolina Ashleys. The significance of the given names
            which frequently appear in more than two generations Avould tend to corroborate the
            tradition. The Johnsons and Glas- sies are found neighbors in all the places where both
            families have lived. The name of Ashley as a land holder is not found on the Public
            records of those parts of Virginia, nor in the Parish or Quaker records, but is well
            known in South Carolina. The only proof we have of such a marriage connection is, as
            stated above, the significance of names. The ancestress was not a de- scendant of the
            family of Lord Ashley, afterward the Earl of Shaftesbury, as a mistaken tradition handed
            down through an aged Quaker declares. There is not the slightest evidence of such a
            marriage, either in the male or female line having taken place. Burke's Peerage [latest
            edition], gives the entire line of Lord Ashley's descendants to' the last child born
            1906. There was a "John Ashley Esqr of London — 1683 " — in the list of Caciques, the
            hereditary nobility of the colony under the Pro- prietary Government, which became
            extinct when that government ceased. From this person there may have been at an early
            period a connection by marriage with the Massies of Ulster or of Charleston. Families of
            all these names are found in the early records and history of South Carolina. " The
            first census of the United States in South Carolina, taken 1790, gives 13:3 Johnsons, 14
            Massie, and S Ashley families in the different districts. Catherine Massie of the
            Charleston dis- trict owned 35 slaves, Henry 4, and James and William Mas&gt;ie 11
            each." The Ashleys held no slaves.</note> Their marriage is entered upon the parish
          register of Christ Church, Middlesex as follows: <note n="44">Parish register Christ
            Church, Middlesex, 1653-lSH, p. -29.</note></p>
        <p>John Johnson II., and Lucinda Blake, <note n="45"> The Blakes were of South Carolina. The
            family were Dissenters, both of this parish, were married Y^ 6 of April,
          1686.</note></p>
        <p>The following tract of land was granted to John Johnson in 1705:</p>
        <p>*' John Johnson, St. Peter's parish, New Kent County, 252 Acres, Bordering on black
          creek, Thomas Snead's Land, formeriy granted to Thomas Reynolds by patent dated 28th of

          the General Court ITth of Aprill, 1705, and is further due unto the said John Johnson for
          the transportation of fiye persons into the Colony whose names are to be in the records

        <p>(Patent Book 9, page 704.)</p>
        <p>This plantation described as "on black creek," in New Kent, was situated not far distant
          from a " particular meeting " of the Quakers on the same creek, which was known as Black
          Creek meeting, and belonged to the venerable Henrico Monthly INIeeting. A number of
          parties in the region round about had, in 1699, contributed to- bacco in variovis amounts
          from " five hundred pounds and three days' work" to five pounds, to build a meeting house
            <note n="46">Southern Quakers and Slavery, p. 76.</note> Thomas Story, a noted English
          Quaker, evangelist, who was born and brought up in the Church of England, "visited the
          colony in 1705 and was treated with much kindness by the Governor." He visited Black Creek
          meeting, Curies over in Henrico County, and other Friends in those parts. It is probable
          that these influences had much to do with ^Adnning the family of Johnson young peo- ple to
          cast their lot with Friends, for it appears to have been early in the century that their
          names were enrolled among the Quakers. Whether or not the parents, John Johnson and his
          wife, united with Friends does not appear, but it is cer- tain that their children joined
          in membership, their marriages having been accomplished and the marriage certificates
          recorded on the Record^*^ books [1699-1756] of the :Monthly Meeting held in Henrico
          County. <note n="47"> Henrica Monthly Meeting was established 169S, or possibly at
            somewhat an earlier date.</note></p>
        <p>The children of John II and Lucinda [Blake] Johnson, were, Ashley, Agnes, John, Massie
          [Massey]. No dates of births of these are re- corded except that of John. <note n="48"

        <p>That there were other children of this family is pretty clear, though we have no accurate

        <p>These early Virginia settlers were migratory, and made many changes in their localities
          of liv- ing. The Meetings also were moved from place to place.</p>
        <p>lit is possible that one reason for these changes was the painful experience and unrest
          into which many were brought because — as was offi- cially stated — " We Can not for
          Concience sake pay the Priests dews &amp; other Church demands." <note n="53"><p>* In 1748
              a new Clergy bill was passed. It was based on and is essentially the same as that of
              1737. The Collectors were now given power to distrain on " slaves, goods, and chattels
              of the person or persons chargeable therewith." There was no provision foT any Class
              of Dissenters.</p>
            <p>In a protest to the Governor and Assembly in 1739 against these forced payments the
              Quakers stated:</p>
            <p>"We pay all taxes for support of Government, we transgress no laws of trade, we keep
              back no part of the revenue due to the crown, the publick are not charged in the
              leaste with our poar, and we nevertheless willingly contribute to the publick poar,
              and endeavor to follow peace with all men." Quakers continued to suffer under the
              provisions of the laws on " Church rates " and " Militia fines." It was reserved for
              the trying days of the Revo- lution to snap asunder the bonds of Church and State. -
              Southern Quakers and Slavery, pp. 152, 153.</p></note></p>
        <p>John Johnson appears to have suffered on re- ligious grounds by distress for tythes,
          having stood against the tything system and been forced by the high Sheriff to yield.</p>
        <p>The following minute is taken from the original records.</p>
        <p>"At our Monthly Meeting held in Caroline County, Y^ 11th 9th mo. 1757, by report from
          Ameha meeting of Friends Sufferings, John Johnson had taken from liim tilings to the value
          of seven pounds, ten shillings."</p>
        <p>By the middle of the century — the eighteenth — the Johnson families had extended their
          bound- aries into Hanover, Campbell, Louisa and ad- jacent counties. John Johnson and his
          wife Elizabeth, after living many years in Hanover County, left their native state and
          removed to North Carolina, taking their grandson, John Johnson, with them. Remaining there
          but two and a half years, we find them again at their home in Hanover County, Va.</p>
        <p>" At our Monthly Meeting held at Cedar Creek 14th day of 12 mo 1765 John Johnson made
          application to this Meeting for a few hnes by way of a certificate for themselves and
          families in order to join the Monthly Meeting of Friends at New Garden North Carolina.</p>

            contem- porary with the Johnsons on the very early parish records of St. Peter's in New
            Kent county, and belonged to the first established Quaker meetings of Virginia. Henry

        <p>By Micajah Crew Clerk. Rachel Moorman Clk.</p>
        <p>Both John Johnson IV and his wife Lydia, appear to have been devoted Friends. Their names
          frequently occur on the meeting records as witnesses to marriages of their neighbors and
          kinsmen. John Johnson, Sen., died 8th month 31st 1816 at a small settlement called Ivv
          Creek, Bedford County, Va., at the age of eighty-four." <note n="56">South River Monthly
            Meeting records.</note> The death of his wife is not on record.</p>
        <p>Children of John Johnson IV and Lydia [Watkins] Johnson: Judith, Susanna, James, Samuel,
          Joseph, John, born 2d mo. 5. 1766, Thomas, Lydia.</p>
        <p>John Johnson IV, the sixth child of John, Sen., and Lydia [Watkins] Johnson, was born 2d
          month 5th 1766.</p>
        <p>Very little is known of his personal history His name is found in the record of births of
          Cedar Creek Meeting.</p>
        <p>As the years went on and the Johnson families multiplied, they changed their localities
          of living, as we have already stated, and many are found, in time, in Louisa, Campbell,
          Bedford and Amelia Counties. The man-iage of John Jolin- son, Jun. (V) is recorded on the
          minutes of South Biver Monthly Meeting <note n="57">Taken from the original
            records.</note></p>
        <p>John Johnson of Bedford County, and Rhoda Moorman of Campbell County, married 10th mo.
          21, 1789, at South River Meeting house. </p>
        <p>The marriage certificate was signed by twenty- seven members of their families and
          kinspeople who were witnesses to their marriage.</p>
        <p>Rhoda Moorman was the daughter of Micajah Susannah Moorman, and the seventh child of a
          family of thirteen children. She was born at Lynchburg, Virginia, 8th month loth,
          1769.</p>
        <p>Here Jolin, Jun. (V) and his wife lived till his death, wliich took place January 14,
          1803.</p>
        <p>Rhoda [Moorman] Johnson <note n="58">
            <p>Micajah Moorman was one of the most prominent early- settlers in Campbell Co., Va. He
              was one of the " gentleman " trustees into whose hands John Lynch vested the " land to
              be laid off in lots and to whom the Genfiral Assembly granted a charter, October 1786
              for " a town to be known by the name of Lynchburg. "Lynchburg and its people," p. 23
              and 68. As long as he lived he was a conspicuous figure in the town and is still held
              in honored memory by its people. He was a Quaker and ceased to hold slaves after the
              Society declared against the practice. Lynchburg, as late as the year 1800, had
              upwards of one thousand slaves. Stephen Grelette, a travelling Quaker minister, says
              in his journal, "the slaves in that part of the country are treated with more cruelty
              than I have seen else- where." ("Life of Stephen Grelette.")</p>
            <p>A quaint and interesting instrument is recorded upon the Campbell Co., Va., records
              showing that William, James, and Christopher Johnson, emancipated twenty-four negro
              slaves in 1782, probably after the conscience of the Quakers had caused them to take
              decided steps against their members keeping negroes in bondage. There are "
              disownments " on record of Thomas Johnson, Samuel Johnson, Samuel Moorman, and others,
              as late as 1795 " for hiring slaves," " for holding a slave," " for pur- chasing a
              slave," and like misdemeanors respecting slavery.</p>
            <p>Such were the environments of Rhoda [Moorman] Johnson during her younger
            years.</p></note> was left a widow with seven children. James, the young- est, was born
          six weeks after his father died.</p>

        <p>The decease of her father, Micajah Moorman, took place 1806. By his will, placed upon
          record, November 25th, 1806, <note n="59"> Probate Records, Campbell Co., Va., Nov. 25,
            1806.</note> he left large tracts of land in the State of Ohio to his wife, Susan- nah,
          and to his daughter Rhoda and other of liis children, and stated in his will that, " I
          desire my wife and her children, who care to, to move to the places in Ohio left them by
          me."</p>
        <p>A great tract of land which was originally of the large military tract set apart by the
          Govern- ment to the State of Ohio, and lay in Warren County, was purchased from Jacob R.
          Brown in 1799, by a Quaker named Abijah O'Xeall. Ohio became a state in 1803, and for many
          reasons which we cannot here discuss, was an inviting field for the migrating Quakers of
          Virginia to possess. " There were no grave obstacles," says Stephen Weeks, " in the way of
          its peaceful conquest, save Indians and distance."</p>

        <p>With irrepressible energy Rhoda [Moorman] Johnson set out on the long journey to Ohio in
          1809 with her seven children. Her certificate <note n="60"> Taken from " Certificates of
            Removal," by South River Monthly Meeting of Friends, Campbell Co., Va.</note> of
          membership addressed to Center Alonthly jNIeeting of Friends, Clinton County, Ohio, dated
          11th mo 11th 1809, recommends her and her children, — the name of each child given, — to
          the " Christian care and oversight " of Friends in her new home and surroundings. They
          were accompanied by her mother, Susannah Moorman, and her granddaughter, Molly Moorman,
          and other emigrants, all of whom settled in Ohio. A large number of relatives and friends
          had pre- ceded them to " Miami," Ohio, in the early spring of 1806, among these were her
          brother Charles Moorman and his family, and eight Johnson families, together with the
          Terrells and Butter- worths.</p>

        <p>John Johnson VI, the third son, and the father of Mrs. Rhoda M. Coffin, was born near
          Lynchburg, Virginia, 1st month 3d, 1795. He was twelve years of age when the family
          removed to Ohio.</p>

        <p>He married Judith Faulkner, <note n="63"><p>"The Faulkners were of the northern u-ing of
              emigrants who were early settlers in P" rede rick County, Virginia, at Hopewell
              Monthly Meeting [or Opequon], and were there as early as 1751. Some members of the
              family who came from Culpepper Co. are found in the more southern settlements in 1766,
              and others went to Xorth Carolina in 1754. But this branch of the family lived in
              Frederick County.</p>
            <p>David Faulkner was born June 25th, 1749. He married, 1770, Judith Thornburg, daughter
              of Abel Thornberg and Brooks.</p>
            <p>The Brooks family went from Culpepper Co., Va., to Han- over County, Va., the middle
              of the century. John Brooks pur- chased land in Louisa County, Va., in 1748.</p>
            <p>On March 28, 1788, Jesse Faulkner conveyed to David Faulkner a tract of 12S acres of
              land described in the deed as lying in the drains of Opequon Creek in Frederick
              County, Va., and the following day Thomas Barnett conveyed to David Faulkner six acres
              adjoining the first mentioned tract. (Deed book 26, p. -275-277. Frederick Co. Records
              Winchester, Va.) On February 5th, 1800, David and Judith Faulkner conveyed this same
              tract of land described in the deed — 129 acres — to James Curl. The Opequon Creek
              flows through a portion of Apple Pie Ridge.</p>
            <p>Again on September 9, 1809, David Faulkner gives a deed of release to James Curl for
              the unpaid purchase money on the same 129 acres, and in the deed he refers to himself
              as "David Faulkner of Green County, Ohio, formerly of Frederick Co., Va."</p>
